Many folks in the surge community make skins beyond the three we ship with the synth. This page contains a set of curated
skins from community desighers for you to download.

To install a skin

1. In Surge 1.9 put unzip the skin and place it in your user directory in the "Skins" directory
2. In Surge XT, unzip the skin and drag it onto a running instance of surge

Although we endeavour to make sure these skins are working, and also try to make sure they contain no inappropriate content,
please use them at your own risk and realize support for errors in them may be less available than with the factory skins.
