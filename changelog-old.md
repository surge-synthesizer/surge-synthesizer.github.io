<div markdown="1" id="1.9.0" style="display: block">

Surge 1.9 is a major feature expansion over January's Surge 1.8 release, including 4 new oscillator types, 15 new effects, a large number of microtuning
enhancements (including support for [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com/)), substantial new content including a set of patches tailor-made
for our new oscillators by Jacky Ligon, and much, much more. In more detail:


* New Oscillators
  * Modern, a low aliasing, clean waveshape oscillator based on extensive research into low aliasing waveform generation methods ([DPW](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224557976_Alias-Suppressed_Oscillators_Based_on_Differentiated_Polynomial_Waveforms) in this case)
  * Alias, a very, very digital oscillator based on ignoring extensive research into low aliasing waveform generation methods, which as a result gives lots of 8-bit joy
  * String, a waveguide-based feedback oscillator, perfect for creating all sorts of stringy, plucky, and plonky sounds
  * Twist, an oscillator based on a [rather famous Eurorack multi-oscillator module](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/)

* New Effects
  * Neuron, a distortion effect based on [Gated Reccurent Unit](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jatin/ComplexNonlinearities/gru.html), done by Jatin Chowdhury
  * CHOW, a [truculent distortion effect](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/CHOW), done by Jatin Chowdhury
  * Exciter, an effect based on a [rather famous aural exciter](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/Aphex_Exciter) unit, done by Jatin Chowdhury
  * Tape, a compact implementation of [Chow Tape Model](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel), done by Jatin Chowdhury
  * 11-band graphical EQ
  * Resonator, inspired by a resonator unit from a very well-known vintage hybrid polyphonic synthesizer that rhymes with "vogue". Contains a few Surge-inspired additions like optionally allowing self-oscillation of resonators through modulation!
  * Combulator, a novel bank of 3 comb filters with feedback, additional noise exciter, separate output volumes for each comb, and individual panning for two out of three combs
  * Ensemble effect with several BBD modes and a clean delay mode, uses a very famous tri-phase dual LFO modulation setup
  * Nimbus, a live input granular processor with built-in reverb, based on [another rather famous Eurorack module](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/)
  * Treemonster, a really wild pitch-tracking ring modulator from Shortcircuit 2, proper Vember Audio classic!
  * Five new Airwindows effects - Galactic, Infinity, Verbity, MatrixVerb and TripleSpread
  * All these effects are also added to SurgeEffectsBank

* Other DSP changes
  * A large number of C++ and SSE improvements in the Sine oscillator, substantially improving performance
  * Oscillator drift now works properly for all oscillator types
  * Oscillator drift now starts at small non-zero random value for each unison voice, rather than starting from 0 (there is also an option to use the old behavior, right-click Osc Drift slider)
  * Character filter will work on new oscillator types (so it's not just for Classic oscillator type anymore - but it is still a global parameter for both scenes!)
  * Retrigger now works properly on all oscillator types
  * Surge now supports single-cycle wavetables (previously, a minimum of two frames were required for the wavetable to load correctly)
  * Wide is the default filter configuration for all templates and Surge's startup state
  * The Asymmetric and Digital waveshapers in the Distortion effect now work properly
  * You can now deactivate Delay R time to allow linking left and right delay times
  * Ring Modulator frequency is now displayed in Hz; also added Absolute mode
  * Reverb 2 now has the same minimum predelay value as Reverb 1
  * Phaser and Neuron can now both deactivate Rate of their internal LFO, in which case modulating Rate will scrub the LFO's phase for manual phasing/combing effects
  * Added 4 new waveshapes in the Sine oscillator
  * More effect types now properly respond to All Notes Off message
  * Hard clip can be configured and set per scene or globally, with new settings at 0 and +18 dBFS (which is the default setting as it were before). You can set this by right-clicking the scene or global volume sliders, or additionally by right-clicking the A/B boxes in the FX grid
  * Sine, FM2 and FM3 oscillator types now have extended range for Feedback parameter by default
  * Maximum polyphony parameter is now actually read from the patches on load (Surge always did store the chosen max polyphony value into the patch, it was just never loaded!)
  * Global Volume doesn't apply to individual scene outputs anymore
  * Added deactivation toggles to low/high cut filters across all effects that didn't have them so far

* Alternate Tuning / Microtonal Interface
  * Provide two tuning application modes: Tuning applied at MIDI input, or after modulation. This is described in detail in the manual. By default, it is set to apply at MIDI input for new patches
  * Filter cutoff can now be tuning-aware
  * Currently loaded SCL/KBM files are now displayed in Tuning menu
  * Far clearer internal and user state management on tuning (= scale + mapping), scale, and mapping management
  * KBM name is now stored in patch and DAW state
  * Tuning is now interpolated in log2 space rather than linear space for more accurate inter-note tuning
  * And finally, thrilled to be one of the first synths to integrate [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com) as a tuning source

* User Interface
  * Reposition Author/Category fields in the factory skins, not to overlap with longer patch names
  * Hover effect is now available on more assets, for example oscillator type menu and FX grid
  * Retrigger and Keytrack button have a right-click option to set their value for all oscillators in a scene
  * Phase/Shuffle parameter now changes its label based on LFO type (will show Shuffle only when Step Seq is selected)
  * Patch browser left-click menu now has multiple columns (Windows only!)
  * Control/Command-drag on sliders to snap to units now works for modulation amounts
  * Control/Command-click on patch or category previous/next buttons will load a random patch!
  * Expanded use of menu for integer sliders in some cases
  * Groups of sliders can now be deactivated collectively, for example in EQ and Tape effects, Twist oscillator...
  * Added an option to always show maximum amplitude LFO as a dotted line (User Settings > Value Displays > Show ghosted LFO waveform reference)
  * Option to drag bottom right corner to resize (VST3 only) is not displayed anymore for skins that have defined fixed zoom levels (i.e. Royal Surge)
  * Added a UI refresh when changing filter type via host automation
  * "Add Modulation From..." option now has its entries organized in submenus per modulator type
  * Removed a check if factory patches are installed. Now it's possible to completely remove all factory/3rd party patches if one wants to, and only focus on making one's own patches with a clean slate!
  * Envelope LFO presets are now saved to Envelope subfolder (previously they went to LFO subfolder)

* Plugin Wrappers
  * AU advertises MPE support now
  * Label all AU parameters as high resolution
  * Disable VST3 parameter name resets which was coded incorrectly in Surge, causing problems in Bitwig
  * VST3 implements `getParamNormalizedByString`, allowing DAW-side value typeins to be consistent with Surge
  * VST3 bug with `getParameterString` fixed, correcting incorrect string display in some cases in Bitwig

* Skin Engine Changes
  * Far clearer skin component model
  * Add a developer mode option (right click Menu button) to overlay a grid on top of Surge's GUI at runtime as a helper tool when designing, with support for arbitrary grid size
  * Fixed some bugs pertaining to user-specified parameter groups
  * Introduced skin version 2 for all the below mentioned new skin engine features:
    * Skin labels can show values from parameter names (useful for i.e. oscillator and FX parameters, which dynamically change their name based on oscillator/FX type)
    * Skin labels can now have an image assigned
    * Oscillator type and FX grid assets now only contain the backgrounds, any text on them is now generated through code
    * Slider class now has font size and text offset properties
    * Added skin properties for positioning the patch browser
    * Added a skin color for showing the current value of a macro more prominently
    * Added skin colors for About page text, column text, link and hovered link

* New Content
  * Patches and FX presets from Vospi
  * FX presets from Arty
  * New patches from Databroth
  * Updated Jacky Ligon patches to set default tuning mode and adjust maximum polyphony
  * Expanded tuning library from Jacky Ligon

* Smaller Changes
  * Show the plugin file location on About screen
  * Show the full modulator name in inter-LFO modulations
  * Show tne entire MSEG curve in Rate deactivated mode
  * When copying an oscillator, remember current position in the wavetable list index
  * About page shows your actual CPU model, not some build-time guess
  * The default value for scene Highpass cutoff parameter is minimum now (6.88 Hz)
  * Increase mouse hitzone on macro sliders slightly
  * Frequencies below C0 now have a proper negative-interval note name
  * Updated a few factory library patches that were using Latch mode by setting them to Mono mode, in order to avoid random noises when browsing through patches
  * Voice LFO Step Sequencer envelope triggers now run properly even without assigned modulation
  * Added a graphical asset for MIDI Learn, so it's now clearer to see when we're in MIDI learn mode and for which parameter
  * Handled a tuning regression when SCL files had a blank title in the first line
  * Next/Prev can span or constrain to category in patch navigation
  * All frequency-based parameters (except LFO rate) can now be set by typing in a note name (using 12-TET to convert to frequency)
  * Zoom level is no longer additionally saved in the DAW state - only the default value stored in user configurationi is used across DAW projects and all Surge instances
  * Wavetable export feature now correctly names the wavetable
  * Existing oscillator modulations are now cleared when changing oscillator type
  * When drag&dropping a patch onto Surge's UI, it is first checked if it exists among the current factory/3rd party/user patches, then that position is used as an anchor for previous/next patch buttons
  * Fixed a bug where loading a patch loaded wavetables twice, causing audio dropouts
  * Fixed a graphics memory leak on Linux, caused by difference in VSTGUI reference count between Linux and Windows/Mac
  * Fixed a bug when changing patches with previous/next patch buttons could skip multiple patches sporadically
  * Default MIDI learn settings are not stored to configuration.xml in factory data folder anymore, but in the always-writeable user data folder
  * When loading patches that contain invalid modulations (for example, Shape parameter in Sine oscillator has some modulation that was made possible in 1.8 and before through certain steps), make sure those modulations are removed to not create any trouble down the road

* Code cleanup
  * Reformatted the codebase with a new, far more sane, clang-format (no more 3 space tabs, and so on!)
  * Replaced our hand-rolled filesystem implementation with [gulak](https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem)
  * GUI overlay API (used for MSEG editor, Store Patch dialog, etc.) is now far more rational, so we can have more than one overlay showing at once
  * Rework `char` and `string` functions to avoid potential overflows in several cases
  * Common oscillator functions (drift, character filter, etc..) are now all found in a single place (OscillatorBase.h)
  * Slider bipolarity and deactivation is now handled in a [single API point](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/blob/main/doc/DynamicNameActivationBipolar.md)
  * Consistently named oscillator and FX related C++ files and classes
  * A non-global RNG used through most of the code where `rand()` was used before
  * Some memory leaks were plugged up!

* Infrastructure
  * More work done on UTF-8 file names and paths on Windows
  * Linux consistently uses `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` as a search path for assets
  * Surge on Windows can now be built with `mingw` or `clang` (but productoin builds are still using MSVC)
  * Linux reads config.xml from the filesystem
  * In Ardour on Linux, work around the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH / GTK2` issue which stopped Zenity from launching
  * Activate warnings-are-errors on Linux gcc
  * Windows implicit `precompiled.h` removed
  * Integrated [libsamplerate](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate) in the codebase, required for Eurorack-based modules which operate at a fixed sample rate of 48k
  * CMake will now run even if `git` is not found

* Surge XT
  * Lots of commits for Surge XT which will hopefully be released sometime this summer!

<div markdown="1" id="1.8.1" style="display: none">

Version 1.8.1 is a point release to clean up a few bugs we found after 1.8.0 release, to add a few features we simply forgot to code, and
to update and add content to the installer which people shared after the 1.8.0. release.

The changes are:

* Bugfixes and Features
   * Handled UTF-16 paths for saving user settings, allowing users on Windows with UTF-16 usernames to update their defaults
   * Drag and drop of a .wav or .wt wavetable doesn't reset oscillator type, if type is set to Window
   * The warning on Windows about uninstalled Lato font shows only once, not once every time the Surge GUI is opened
   * About screen actually mentions Surge Synth Team!
   * About screen on Windows shows "x86" instead of "Intel" for CPU
   * Modulation depth display and typein for tempo synced parameters is implemented now (as opposed to being just nonsense)
   * Subfolders in modulator presets are now listed first, before files
   * Dismissed the value display popup when toggling modulation assign mode on/off
   * Resolved Python with /usr/bin/env on Linux in the build phase
   * Fixed an occasional, but serious crash which would occur on slower machines when rapidly changing patches
   * Reordered and improved the MSEG segment menu
   * Drag and drop FX movement retains assigned modulation
   * Fixed a mis-drawn MSEG hover segment when scrolling horizontally
   * Added an explicit menu setting for touchscreen mode for Windows users (under User Settings->Mouse Behavior)
   * Avoided a floating point underflow which rendered MSEG S-curve deforms incorrectly when Deform was a very small value
   * Failure to load a .wav file will not rename the patch wavetable anymore
   * Fixed a typo which resulted in the Hard waveshaper sounding wrong in Rotary and Distortion effects

 * Content
   * Added a bunch of modulator presets
   * High quality versions of all factory wavetables in Basic folder
   * Updated Jacky Ligon's presets with new patches and CPU optimizations
   * Updated TMNG's presets with new patches, CPU optimizations and cleaner wavetables

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.8.0')">Changes in Surge 1.8.0</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.8.0" style="display: none">

In version 1.8.0, we have introduced many new features,
but also adapted a large collection of existing open source code to work
inside Surge. We are especially grateful to these authors (noted in the changelog)
for making their software available, for being friendly when we talked to them about
adapting their software for Surge, and for being part of the free and open source
music software community!

1.8 has hundreds of changes and features, but the headlines of the release are:

* New skins, including the lovely "Royal Surge" skin and greatly improved Classic and Dark skins
* New filters, with multiple new filter models
* A complete implementation of a multi-segment envelope generator (MSEG) as a modulation source
* A large number of Airwindows FX available in the FX chain
* A bunch of amazing new content! We now have more than 2000 presets in the library!

The complete changelog is:

* New and Improved Skins
   * Added the 'Royal Surge' skin, a skin inspired by vintage hardware, developed and designed
     by [Voger Design](https://vogerdesign.com).
   * Major updates to the Classic and Dark surge skin, including better placement of controls, rendering,
     contrast, and consistency.
   * See "Skin Engine" section below for more technical details on the skinning engine

* Filters
   * Added "Vintage Ladders", two models of vintage 4-pole lowpass ladder filters
        Thanks to [@ddiakopoulos](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos) for maintaing this very
        useful [repository of research and code](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders) which
        heavily informed the models we implemented
   * Added the filter from [OB-Xd](https://github.com/reales/OB-Xd)
   * Added the K-35 filter from [Odin 2](https://github.com/TheWaveWarden/odin2)
   * Added the Diode Ladder filter from [Odin 2](https://github.com/TheWaveWarden/odin2)
   * Added Cutoff Warp filters (LP/BP/HP/N/AP) based on [this Jatin Chowdhury Blog Post](https://jatinchowdhury18.medium.com/complex-nonlinearities-episode-5-nonlinear-feedback-filters-115e65fc0402). This one is really weird!
   * Added Resonance Warp filters (LP/BP/HP/N/AP) based on [this Jatin Chowdhury Blog Post](https://jatinchowdhury18.medium.com/complex-nonlinearities-episode-4-nonlinear-biquad-filters-ae6b3f23cb0e)
   * Implemented 24 dB/oct variants for the existing biquad bandpass and notch filter types
   * Add an allpass biquad filter based on existing biquad filters in Surge
   * Fixed an error in the comb filter which made it out of tune by 6 samples. By default
     this is corrected in new sessions or patches streamed with Surge 1.8, but it can be also toggled by right-clicking the filter
     subtype menu. Old patches remain "wrong" in order to preserve how your existing projects sound
   * Overhauled the filter type menu, filters are now grouped by their function

* Expanded Modulator Features and Fixes
   * Multi-Segment Envelope Generator (MSEG)
     * Implemented a fully editable MSEG modulation source, with a large number of curve types and various editing options
     * To use the MSEG, select a voice or scene LFO, choose the MSEG LFO type (bottommost row, first icon) and click on the LFO display, or the pencil button to the right
     * Extended features for a segment are available on the right click context menu
     * Currently, MSEG supports up to 128 nodes, and the maximum length of the MSEG is 128 phase units (duration of a single phase unit is determined by the LFO Rate parameter)
   * LFO modulator presets - users can save and share single LFO modulator settings
   * New MIDI controller modulators: Breath, Expression, Sustain pedal
   * New per-voice modulators: Alternate and Random (both unipolar and bipolar)
   * New scene modulators: Lowest Key, Highest Key, Latest Key
   * Drag and Drop
     * Drag a Macro slot around to reorder it
     * Ctrl-drag any modulation source onto a slider in order to open an edit dialog for typing in a modulation amount
   * Added several MIDI controller smoothing modes in the MIDI Settings menu, which
     increase the responsiveness (at cost of smoothness) for MIDI CCs, aftertouch, etc.
   * MPE Aftertouch and Timbre are now properly smoothed; MPE Pitch Bend has independent
     smoothing settings.
   * Deactivated rate LFO modulators show their waveform over which you can scrub using the Phase slider
   * LFO Freerun trigger mode now has correct relation to song position pointer when not synced to tempo
   * LFO Deform slider now has several different modes for Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth and Envelope LFO types

* Effects
   * Integrated 59 [Airwindows effects](https://github.com/airwindows/airwindows). Thanks to Airwindows
     for providing high quality open source effects!
   * Effects can be reordered via drag and drop, copied to another slot via Ctrl/Cmd+drag and drop, or replaced via Shift+drag and drop
   * Phaser effect now has an adjustable number of stages (up to 16), with adjustable spread and distribution of stages (except in legacy setting)
   * Extended phaser ringout time, allowing for long self-oscillations at high feedback
   * Vocoder modulator signal can now be chosen between stereo, monosum, left, or right input
   * Disabling an effect (loading the "off" preset) now removes any leftover modulation
   * Individual bands of the EQ can now be deacivated by right-clicking the Gain sliders and choosing Deactivate

* SurgeEffectsBank
   * SurgeEffectsBank is now part of the main Surge source tree
   * Implemented the new Airwindows effects

* Voice Management
   * Added note priority modes for monophonic play modes: latest, highest, lowest or legacy (note ons have latest note priority, note offs have highest note priority)
   * Added a mode where sustain pedal in mono mode allows retriggering older notes that are still held, on note release
   * Add even more extensive regression tests for voice management modes

* Other Sound Design Tools
  * FM3 Oscillator
     * M1/2/3 can now be extended allowing ratios from 1/32 to 32
     * M1/2 can now be set to a ratio or an absolute frequency
  * Fixed a bug in step sequencer LFO mode which picked the wrong step when start and end were the same
  * LFO Amplitude can be extended into negative ranges
  * "Tempo-sync All Parameters" available for filter and amp envelopes
  * Display Pitch Bend as a bipolar modulator on sliders
  * Fixed problems with very long-running LFOs drifting due to truncation errors

  * Waveshaper drive can now be extended to have twice as much gain as before (+/- 48 dB)
  * Default scene polyphony is now set to 16
  * Solo buttons in the mixer now allow multiple active solos by default (Ctrl/Cmd+click for the old exclusive solo behavior)
  * Mute buttons in the mixer behave the same way as Solo buttons now, with exclusive mute behavior on Ctrl/Cmd+click
  * Expanded .wt file format to support 16-bit full-range files - this also means compatibility with wavetables from Bitwig Studio's Wavetable device!
  * "Show Current Tuning Information" now contains interval matrices
  * Post-amplifier highpass filter can now be deactivated (right-click the HP slider)
  * Global hard clipping of the scene output can now be disabled in Scene Volume context menu
  * Scene pitch and pitch bend now work properly with non-keytracked oscillators
  * Fixed a tuning error with partially mapped long scales
  * Oscillator FM routing modes with only Ring 1x2 mixer channel active now work properly (previously this wasn't evaluated so it resulted in clicks)

* Content
  * Fixed tuning of Flute 1/2 factory patches
  * New patches from Vincent Zauhar
  * New patches from David Bata

  * Text input dialogs are no longer OS-based, instead they are internal to Surge, created with VSTGUI
  * Store Patch dialog is now consistently designed with other internal dialogs in Surge
  * Fixed VST3 zoom inconsistencies which caused problems in Cubase, FL20, and other hosts
  * New "Add Modulation From..." menu entry for modulatable parameters, which opens a dialog for a direct modulation assignment from one of available and valid modulators for the target
  * Hovering over sliders shows which modulation sources are applied to them
  * Direct assignment of MIDI CCs to parameters via context menu, mirroring the same facility Macros have
  * Modified the design of Edit Modulation dialog to avoid text overflows

  * Save FX presets to unique subfolders per FX
  * Step Sequencer shows position in deactivated LFO Rate mode (when scrubbing the sequencer position with the Phase/Shuffle parameter)
  * Modulation assign mode now stays active when selecting another modulator (previously it would deactivate)
  * Added "Clear MIDI Settings" function (Menu > MIDI Settings)

  * If the audio engine isn't running, plugins show idle error when patches won't load
  * Menus, typeins, and other controls now properly send automation change messages
  * Simultaneous automation of any number of parameters now correctly update the UI (previously more than
    8 simultanously automated parameters would leave the UI state incorrect).
  * Modify the threading pattern in the VST3 when loading patches to allow frequent automated patch changes without a crash
  * VST3 correctly supports the 'parameterNormalized' API, which is used extensively in Ardour for automation

* Python API
  * Surge now exposes a complete Python API to fully program and manipulate the synth inside Python programs and Jupyter notebooks

  * Allowed the tarball and code to build and collect version info in the absence of a git checkout
  * Parallel, Debug, and multi-generator CMake builds now work on all platforms
  * Enumerate Linux library dependencies on all items (xcb-keypress etc.)
  * Implemented proper Unicode filename support everywhere
  * Made our CMake file more modular for various library and test inclusions
  * We now show the install location at the last step of the Windows installer
  * Replaced CriticalSection.cpp with `std::mutex`
  * A far more complete implementation of `std::filesystem` for systems which don't have it (basically, macOS versions before 10.15)
  * Refactored our CMake implementation so that shared code is compiled into static libraries
  * Revamped the mechanism by which Surge internal IDs and Surge plugin IDs are mapped, allowing us a much easier
    future expansion of the parameter set (sctual parameter set expansion is coming in 1.9!)
  * LFO and S&H noise oscillators now have independent random number generators, avoiding problems with global seeds
  * Consistently use constants for scenes, oscillators and so on, rather than magic numbers "2" and "3" and so on
  * Purged unused/obsolete graphical assets from the codebase
  * Turned on "warnings are errors" on all platforms
  * Correctly set macro values on patch load by calling 'init()' rather than 'set_target()'
  * Fix some edge case threading problems which were exposed in high stress (rapid FX swap or rapid VST3 preset reset) cases

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.7.1')">Changes in Surge 1.7.1</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.7.1" style="display: none">

  So, testing is hard. We're a scrappy rag tag group of volunteers facing an army of
  diverse operating systems, DAWs, environments, build flags, and so on. We're really happy
  that all the new features in 1.7.0 worked! But upon release we found some of the environmental
  stuff didn't, so we did a quick 1.7.1 release which includes the following fixes,
  most of which were cause by us doing a substantial upgrade to our build infrastructure with
  1.7.0. We still have a swath of features planned for the 1.7 series, and expect a 1.7.2 with
  some new features and effects in Autumn 2020.

<ul>
  <li>macOS</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Make the VST3 work in Abelton Live for Mac (by doing a blank-signing of the bundle)</li>
    <li>Restore compatability back to OS 10.9 (by building macOS at C++-14 level).</li>
    <li>Change the support file lookup semantic to always use the newest support files</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Linux and FreeBSD</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Activate an Ubuntu-20 Clang-10 build and resolve bugs</li>
    <li>Remove a set of warnings that stop Clang-9 from building, allowing Surge to build on FreeBSD again</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Windows</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Modify the VST3 zoom failure handler, which would cause an infinite loop in zooms on Studio One in some situations.</li>
    <li>Change our build pipeline so the 64-bit Windows installer installs the 64-bit SurgeEffectsBank</li>
  </ul>
  <li>All Platforms</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add greatly improved labels on value menus for filter subtypes and envelope attacks</li>
    <li>Improve error messages for missing skins</li>
    <li>Add a 'Zoom to Default' menu item which zooms to the user default setting</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

      + Fixed problems with the ADSR envelope becoming unstable or non-silent in very high or very low DS regimes
+ Modulation and Voice Management Changes
   + Each voice LFO can now trigger filter and amplifier envelopes
   + You can 'deactivate' the LFO rate (right click the Rate slider to see the option in the context menu) which makes the LFO take a
     constant value at current phase, and makes the Phase slider act like a scrub operator
   + Step Sequencer UI rewrite
      + Vector rendering
      + Show the actual resulting curve

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.6.6')">Changes in Surge 1.6.6</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.6" style="display: none">

Version 1.6.6 fixes several bugs and adds a few key features. We released so quickly after 1.6.5 since we want to take a pause on doing regular production releases while we
prepare for a Surge 1.7 release which will include (among other things) a skinning engine to allow designers to adapt
the UI. As such, this will be our last production release for a little while - perhaps until summer of 2020. Changes in 1.6.6 are

* Audio and Performance Changes
  * Absolute unison mode was both sample rate dependant and incorrectly calibrated. Corrected it so that, at all sample
    rates, a 16 Hz absolute unison is a 16 Hz unison spread.
  * Unison range can now be extended, giving unison spreads up to one octave (pitch) or 192 Hz (absolute).
  * Window Oscillator now supports FM, and is calibrated to use the same FM Depth as FM2/3/Sine oscillators.
  * We initialize modulators before the initial voice start, setting the first modulator value at voice initialization corectly and
    avoiding a 32 sample "sweep" across a modulator value at voice onset.
  * Fixed two bugs with the sustain pedal; first - sustain on channels 3 and 4 didn't work, and second - pressing a key
    multiple times while sustain was held would lead to an incorrect state.
  * Fixed a bug with the tuning engine where mappings with root keys far outside of scale ranges gave incorrect results
  * Made the oscillator display constant even in extreme tuning changes
* LV2 Changes
  * The LV2 had incorrectly advertised the identity of its ports. Change to use unique symbols for each port. *Unfortunately this fix will break prior Surge sessions, but those prior sessions inconsistently streamed the synth state in most LV2 hosts*
  * The LV2 didn't advertise all parameter changes leading to a port being unsynchronized.
* Minor Changes
  * The VST3 (Windows) plugin properly formats the automation display of the CC parameters
  * The FX slots and automation parameters are named more consistently, as are several menus and labels
  * The value popup window popsup on mouse-down not mouse-move on a slider
  * The patch and wavetable menus have refresh options on the popup menu, not just in menu/data and patches
  * Slider mouse behavior in medium and slow works more like classic when over-dragging
  * Added an init patch which assigns a distinct modulator envelope to each OSC
  * Added a regtest that parameter IDs are stable across versions
  * Modify the build pipeline so the linux .deb file has correct ownership on shared assets
  * Stream the Wavetable name into the patch
  * Correct the Open Tuning Library menu on Windows
  * Fixed a bug with opening and closing the VST2 on Linux

</div>

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.6.5')">Changes in Surge 1.6.5</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.5" style="display: none">

* New Features
   * Added a "Channel Split" mode to split by MIDI channel across scenes, just like the Key Split mode does across the keyboard
   * Several changes to the alternate tuning implementation
      * We have full support for Scala KBM files, including full keyboard
        remapping, scale 0, and frequency 0 selection.
      * The default tuning constant key is MIDI note 60 (261.63 Hz)
      * The scale viewer shows frequencies per key
      * Corrected an error where tuning could interfere with filter cutoffs and delay timings, especially with long scales

* Modulation Section
   * When any control is tempo synced, show a beats display as well as time display on the LFO grid (not available on Linux)
   * Tempo sync all controls for an LFO modulator with a single RMB gesture on any syncable control.
   * Added LFO Envelope lanes in the LFO 1 retrigger section. Use Shift-click or right-click on the retrigger section to trigger both the Amp and Filter envelope or just one or the other.
   * Made envelope retrigger work properly for Analog mode envelopes.
   * Chose a more on-theme blue for the step sequencer section, rather than that wierd green.
   * Green line shows how far you have modulated when you modulate a slider. Try it!

* MPE
   * The global pitch bend (on channel 1) no longer double-bends in MPE mode
   * MPE pitch bend state is per instance and saved in the DAW state, so you can use two Surges with MPE bend of 24 and 48 in a single project, if you happen to own  both a Seaboard and a Linnstrument, say.

* VST3
  * Sidechain support is properly supported with a kAux channel, meaning sidechain works in Cubase Pro. Additionally, in Reaper versions > 6.02 the VST3 will properly configure routing for sidechaining when dragged into a track. (For earlier versions see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKR0x_dneYI).)
  * Support VST3 context menus. Right-click on a parameter in VST3 using a DAW that supports this feature and check it out!
  * VST3 automation for macros works.
  * LFO freerun works if transport is not running.

* Change the Windows Installation Locations
   * Windows now reads shared content from %PROGRAMDATA% (c:\ProgramData\Surge) and then if missing from %LOCALAPPDATA%
   * The Windows Installer installes common assets in %PROGRAMDATA%
   * To allow debugging, the About screen on all platforms shows the data paths.

* A new collection of third party presets from Dan Mauer.

* Other Workflow and Engine Improvements
  * You can export a wavetable from a patch to a standalone wavetable using the export menu item in the oscillator wavetable selector
  * The Envelopes in analog mode corrected decay behavior and support sustain swells
  * The Digital envelopes in quadritic decay mode work with sustain 0
  * LFO phase is properly modulatable (modulated phase is snapped when an LFO starts and is not modulatable once going)
  * TempoSync was not correctly unstreamed on the Delay effect.
  * TempoSync in Delay is correctly initialized when first played in a new DAW instance.
  * The AU unstreams zoom properly in Logic Pro
  * The AU allows automation of the "CC" and "Master" parameters properly

* Other UI Improvements
  * Windows Touch devices now work with the Surge UI
  * Fix a problem with a 'spiky' draw of the Square Wave on Windows
  * Several UI elements are higher contrast, several text displays are more consistently formatted
  * Frequency sliders (like Cutoff frequency) show a midi name as well as a frequency in their popups and string displays
  * TempoSync sliders show their status with a little "TS" on the handle.
  * FrameClose in the VST2 called at the appropriate time.
  * VST Names for FX Params are distinct per param

* Code Changes
  * Add and activate many unit tests spanning tuning, modulation, and much more
  * Add support for builds with Visual Studio 2019

</div>

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.6.4.1')">Changes in Surge 1.6.4.1</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.4.1" style="display: none">

Versions 1.6.4 and 1.6.4.1 were released late November 2019, with several MPE and effect changes, new content, and some small
cleanups

* Synth Sound and Behavior
   * Release velocity is now an available modulation source. See [more details here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnEX-ypuem0)
   * Sustain Pedal in MPE mode was mis-mapped to the wrong channel, leading to it not working in MPE note-per-channel configurations
   * The 'Drive' feature in the distortion effect is extensible

* New Content
   * A set of MPE patches for the Linnstrument provided by Roger Linn. [Here's a video of Roger demonstrating them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-mKyShEvKg&t=1s)
   * Producer [Damon Armani](http://damon-armani.com) contributed a set of EDM & Dubstep Wavetables and Patches to the 3rd party library.

* Other smaller changes
   * Mouse button shows value of integer and boolean sliders
   * Fix a small repaint bug in the LFO display
   * Handle cases where user folders don't exist
   * Make LFO modulation button state always consistent
   * Better abbreviated names of modulation sources, with consistent case and spelling
   * Failed wav file loads include the name of the file which failed
   * Developer documentation cleanup and unit tests

* 1.6.4.1 was a minor release that corrected the installer on macOS Catalina, renamed and completed a couple of the new content packs and fixed two small graphics assets.

</div>

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.6.3')">Changes in Surge 1.6.3</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.3" style="display: none">

1.6.3 fixes a collection of problems with the VST3 plugin. We are particularly grateful to the team
at Steinberg for providing us a complementary copy of the Cubase DAWs which best exhibited the VST3 bugs
Surge had, and allowed us to resolve the problems.

* VST3 Fixes galore
   * Pitchwheel and Modwheel work VST3/Cubase
   * Resolved bugs in midi mapping, midi learn, and other controller flows
   * Resolve VST3 automation inconsistently updating the Surge UI
   * Support drag-to-zoom in VST3 in hosts which support it (tested in Reaper, FL, Bitwig and Cubase)

* Upgraded the distortion effect
   * Users can select the waveshaper for the drive stage from the set of surge waveshapers
   * The pre- and post- gain can be extended to allow outsized boosts and subsequent extreme distortions
   * Note that some settings of the distortion effect in extended mode can drive Surge well into digital clipping. Be careful!

* New patches from Inigo Kennedy

* Several LV2 and Linux changes, including the ability to build a 32 bit linux configuration.

* Deal with some small bugs with wave ordering, invalid waves, menu arrow keys on Linux, and error handling when Surge is mis-installed

</div>

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.6.2.1')">Changes in Surge 1.6.2.1</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.2.1" style="display: none">

1.6.2.1 is a point release fixing a few regressions in 1.6.2 and a few crashes our users noticed when more
people downloaded the synth.

* Fix a long-standing MPE error where channel aftertouch was mis-routed
* Restore the "extended" menu on Oscillator pitch; apply a few other cosmetic menu changes
* Build patch menu correctly when user directory names exactly match factory directory names
* On Linux systems without zenity installed, fail gracefully instead of SEGV
* Apply naming consisntency to wavetables as well as patches

</div>

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.6.2')">Changes in Surge 1.6.2</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.2" style="display: none">

* Substantial New Features
  * Alternate Tunings
    * Surge supports re-tuning the synthesizer using .scl files
    * .scl files are stored in the DAW state and optionally stored in a patch
    * UI elements to see if tuning is active, to see current tuning, and to reset tuning in place
  * Greatly expanded `.wav` file support and WaveTable Oscillator improvmenets
    * Surge can read `.wav` files on all platforms (linux, mac, and windows) now
    * Surge will recognize `.wav` files which contain a `clm` block to indicate loop size (as used by Serum),
      a `cue` block (as used by various products, including Native Instruments) and a `smpl` block.  *This means that
      all Serum compatible wavetables we have tried now load in surge*
    * Add a `srge` chunk type which allows wav files to advertise surge table sizes other than 2048, and a python script
      to add those chunks to wav files.
    * `.wav` files without loop information are loaded as one-shots
    * Increased the maximum table size to 4096 samples.
    * Drag and drop of .wav files, direct open with the file chooser, and scanning of .wav files in
      ~/Documents/Surge are available
    * The WaveTable and Window Oscillator Morph control shows the table and allow you to snap exactly to a table
  * Important Linux Changes
    * A Linux 64 bit LV2 is now available
    * A Llinux 64 bit VST3 is now available, although VST3 support in Linux is sporadic, and it only fully works in Reaper
    * Resolve problems with mis-animated, crashing, or ghosting menus in the Linux UI; and mis-aligned text fields in Reaper
  * Audio and Patch Creation Changes
    * Oscillator pitch can be set to "Absolute" using the right mouse, making the pitch shift in absolute
      frequency as opposed to relative note space.
    * Temposync Display values use musical values ("1/4 triplet" rather than "2.667 1/16")
    * The SIN oscillator implements FM feedback; and corrects some errors in the FM implementation making
      it respond line an unmodulated FM2 when no feedback or waveshape is applied.
    * The Surge Vocoder adds tunable bands, adjustable band count, and a different set of bands for modulator than carrier.
    * It is possible to copy and paste FX between slots in the FX router
    * For some lower resolution generated wavetables, add side-by-side high resolution ones
  * Oscillator and LFO Displays
    * The Oscillator display and LFO display are both vectorized, eliminating the high-zoom pixelation of prior versions.
    * The LFO display automatically zooms to show the entire envelope; and releases the sampled LFO to show the release stage.
    * Due to a technical limitation in Linux VSTGUI that we are still debugging, these features are only available in the
      Windows and Macintosh build today. Also on some older machines this feature will auto-deactivate if it is too slow;
      and can be forcibly deactivated with a switch in the menu.
  * The SurgeEffectsBank plugin.
     * We have wrapped the FX stage of surge as a separate JUCE plugin and generated a VST3
     * This plugin is included in the mac and windows installer.
  * New and Reorganized Content
     * EMU has adapted the CC-0 VSCO Community Edition (https://vis.versilstudios.com/vsco-community.html) as a collection
       of surge wavetables
     * EMU digital and sampled wavetables added in third party wavetables
     * EMU patches added to third party patches
     * Added a few presets by Claes which we found outside the factory distribution
     * Generally reorganized the presets to have more consistent case, name, and folder sturcture.
     * Place content too large for the core distribution on a wiki site and link it through menus in the main menu,
       patch menu, and wavetable menu.

* Bug Fixes, Host and DAW changes
  * Parameter automation in the Audio Unit corrected, allowing touch automation of parameters in LogicProX
  * Zoom issues resolved in renoise windows with renoise 3.2 upgrade
  * Zoom issues resolved in reaper linux by using the Linux VST3 rather than VST2
  * Oscillator copy and paste mis-copied dynamic wavetables; fixed
  * Oscillator copy and paste always copied oscillator 1; fixed
  * Automating OSCTYPE as a DAW parameter gives the correct behavior in the UI and the audio engine
  * Automating ENVTYPE as a DAW parameter updates the UI properly
  * Fix VST2 overflow which was stopping plugin from working in QTractor
  * VST3 UI responds properly to automation
  * VST3 shows parameter value strings correctly mac and linux

* Other UI Changes
  * A status area shows MPE and Tuning state, allows it to be edited, and allows the menu to be opened
  * Increased contrast and correctly anti-aliased labels in several parts of the skin
  * VST3 remembers its zoom setting inside a session
  * Linux hosts with zenity installed will see error prompts, rename prompts, and other UI
    elements available on Mac and Windows
  * Windows mice with 5 buttons can use buttons 4 and 5 (the side buttons) to toggle modulation
    when over a slider or modulation source
  * The Solo UI accurately renders the state of the mixer, showing the single-solo bus.
  * Fixed a bug where modulation sliders could reset to max when dragged far below min
  * "Chan. AT" renamed "Channel AT"

<h1><a href="javascript:toggleCl('1.6.1.1')">Changes in Surge 1.6.1.1</a></h1>

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.1.1" style="display: none">

* Fix two big concerns raised as people used 1.6.0
  * Dynamically allocate wavetable loading memory so that large wavetables no longer crash
    (as fixed below) but small wavetables don't bloat memory on low mem systems.
  * Fix two bugs in the VST3 zoom-dance supression which caused some versions of FL20 on Win to
    misdraw.

* Add new modes to the Sin oscillator by quadrant masking and shifting and pitch doubling.
* Several code-level changes to clean up warnings and make surge-rack easier.
* Version 1.6.1.1 also contains a tiny fix which resolves a crash with re-opening zoomed windows in Logic
  which is not in 1.6.1

<div markdown="1" id="1.6.0b9" style="display: none">

* Move the entire UI to vector / SVG rendering for elements rather than bitmap
  rendering. This leads to cleaner pixel accurate zooms at all resolutions.

  any use of the pitch wheel stuck surge out of tune and some hosts
  (most notably Fruity Loops 20) were always a half step sharp in VST3.

  * Correct a VST3 Mouse Wheel bug where, at some zoom settings, a mouse wheel
    would move an unrelated control slider.
  * Add user-selectable mouse speed settings allowing consistent speed by slider.
  * Add ability to re-scan all user folders when content has changed.

* Code Cleanups, API changes, and crash fixes
  * Fix a crash when midi program changes selected a patch out of bounds (but
    midi program change support is still inadequate)
  * Variety of code cleanups, including support for a headless build
    completely free of vstgui and vstsdk, and code changes to allow surge to
    build the dsp engine in the VCV Rack environment
  * Fix a variety of small memory and uninitialized errors.
  * Add a python script to dump a surge patch to stdout.
  * Add a File/Open dialog in the UserInteractions namespace.
  * Improved developer documentation on builds, git, and more.
