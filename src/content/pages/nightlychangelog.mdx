# Nightly headed to 1.3 change log

We plan to release Surge XT 1.3 sometime in mid/late autumn 2023.

This is up to date as of Aug 13 / 343fbbacbb

## Open Sound Control

-   Surge adds a complete open sound control implementation. For more information, see _what??_

## A CLI / True-Headless Synth

-   we added a pure CLI/No GUI version of the surge synthesizer for total headless playback
-   surge-xt-cli (on linux), the cli executable in the standalone bundle (mac). Windows users must
    download separately
-   Combined with Open Sound Control and MIDI Program Change support, this allows a variety of
    new and useful embedded and headless performance options

## New Effects: Bonsai and Audio In

-   Write this

## DSP Additions and Changes

-   The Digital Ring Modulator (RM1x2 and 2x3 in the mixer) gains a large number
    alternate combinator modes.
-   FM3 M3 frequency extendable down to 0.5 hz
-   Oscillator initialization ignored the octave setting. This caused a very small initial
    gliss in the String and (in some cases) modern oscillator. Correct this to remove the
    gliss
-   Sin, FM2, and FM3 get a 'vintage feedback' mode (right mouse the Feedback slider) using a
    longer feedback window for slightly smoother feedback results.
-   The default Comb Filter buffer is twice as long (4096 samples) allowing lower frequency
    physical modelling at high sample rates. Self builders can reduce this size if they need to
    preserve memory through a CMake switch.

## Tuning-related changes

-   The tuning editor gets two new visualizations. The "True Keys" mode shows actual keys depressed and the
    interval betwene them. The "Radial" mode changes to "Polar" with both a "Radial" and "Angular" mode.
-   The tuning editor converts into a tuning analyzer in MTS-ESP mode, showing the new True Keys mode against
    MTS-ESP sources
-   Option to blanket ignore ODDSound-MTS removed.
-   Disconencting from ODDSound-MTS on an instance-by-instance basis is remembered in teh DAW state
-   Misleading tuning-related type-ins in 'tune-after-modulation' mode now present accurate errors

## MIDI and Performance Changes

-   Support MIDI Program Change
    -   The user patch directory contains a `MIDI Programs` directory
    -   Patches in the top level form a bank 0 if present
    -   Subdirectories form bank 0 ... 128 if no top level patches present of 1...127 if so
-   Support MIDI learn on all channels by channel
-   Disallow learn on reserved MIDI CCs
-   Dual scene mode in MPE and Latch-with-23-routing-off mis-released voices,
    leaving the non-active scene playing on release. Correct

## Other Changes

-   Patch Save Factoriy Overwrite available with shift-alt-click
-   Clap Parameter Menus work
-   Clap remote-control pages get an initial implementation
-   CLAP polymod works properly with per-channel and per-key polyphonic modulation, whereas
    previously it just worked per note
-   Standalones with a non-null playhead still ignore it and use the standalone tempo
-   Show input latency when block sizes are not power of 32 on the audio-input oscillator and FX
-   Use built-in windows for all alerts and notifications, no longer using the JUCE generic alert
-   XY drags in the filter window send VST automation events as well as modifying the filter
-   Multuple virtual keyboard layouts
-   Remove an unused button from the keyboard shortcuts editor which mis-read with screen readers
-   Limit wavetable load dialog to .wav and .wt only
-   Hide custom menu icons when menus are in accessible-expansion mode
-   FX Swap with drag and drop participates in undo
-   Add an unassigned-by-default but bindable key for random patch action
-   Fix a problem with the use of bold fonts in menus which mis-render menu headers in some macOS situations
-   You can mute an entire scene with the scene volume parameter
-   Disconnecting from MTS-ESP in a single instance is stored in the DAW state
-   The Standalone application works in FullScreen mode. Choose "Zoom/Enter Full Screen" to try.
-   The Oscillator Display uses the half rate filter to show the waveform, which shows a
    more accurate waveform in a couple of (high noise FM) cases.
-   Buttons on the oscilloscope and a few other places use correct hover-off color
-   Fix several points where the MSEG could generate or persist NaN values in the editor
-   Swapping macro modulators gesture participates in undo

## Code Factoring and Quality

-   A large number of efforts went to moving code from surge into libraries shared between
    surge and shortcircuit including:
    -   moving many effects to the sst-effects library
    -   moving fundamental operators to the sst-basic-blocks library
    -   each of these moves included code improvements of various forms
-   With JUCE 7, remove the modibund per-type class extensions
-   The entire code base has uniform file comments and header guards
-   Centralize our locale based formatting using the libfmt locale
-   Remove some uses of `shared_ptr<T[]>` which dont work with the VCV Rack build environment
-   Make sure we properly obey `__restrict` on gcc
-   Consistently use `uses_wavetable` for all queries about wavetable usage
-   Fix an assumption about parameter layout in FXStorage
-   Fix a collection of typos across the code comments

## Infrastructure

-   Upgrade to JUCE 7.0.5 (plus a couple of accesibility patches)
-   Remove the LV2 from the binary distribution
-   Tweak our CI/Azure strategy to improve time from commit to nightly
-   Innclude the mistakenly unincluded for gcc13
-   Surge builds on RPI on 64 bit OS but not 32; fail the 32 bit raspberry pi build earlier
-   Expand documentation about polypohnic modulation, about raspberry pi, and others
-   Move to catchv3; enable CTest
-   Improve unit test runtimes
-   Move windows production compiler to CLang
-   Move minimum CMake version to 21
-   Move macOS notarization from altool to notarytoool
-   Consistently build for macOS 10.9 across all sub-modules
-   Fix compile on Clang 15 on macOS
