# Lua Wavetable Script Editor

- New Lua scripting environment, allowing for the generation, programming, and configuration of wavetables from Lua code
- Generated wavetables are applied directly to the wavetable oscillator and can be exported as `.wav` and `.wt` files or specifically for Serum and VCV Rack
- Exported wavetables include metadata to preserve the generating scripts and parameters
- Support for a new `.wtscript` preset format that generates the resulting wavetable when loaded
- Includes a collection of wavetable scripts for use, exploration, and learning
- FFT functions and a new Prelude library with helper functions specifically for Wavetable scripting

# New Effect: Floaty Delay

# Formula Changes

- Added parameters `voice_count`, `voice_id`, `poly_limit`, `is_rendering_to_ui`, `scene_mode`, `play_mode`, `split_point`, `mpe_enabled` and `tuned_key`
- Added a global table named `shared` which is available to all Formula instances across all voices
- Custom Formula output names now save in Formula presets
- Deprecated macro subscriptions; macros are now always available by default
- Added missing parameters to the Formula init function state
- New "Ranged Keytrack" and "Euclidean Sequencer" presets
- The Formula tutorials "Both Time And Space" and "Reich - Piano Phase" now use exact BPM values
- Added confirmation alert when closing the editor with unapplied changes via keybindings
- Fixed a possible crash when switching to an unused output

# Open Sound Control

- FX Parameter name changes update in a more modulator / granular fashion

# Effect Changes

- Nimbus (based on Mutable Clouds) updates resampling to be consistent with 
  Twist
- Fix a problem where CHOW mix was stuck at 100%
- Fix a problem where, in certain configurations, at very very low drive, the
  distortion effect could become unstable.

# Build Environment and Dependencies

- Move to github actions
- Remove windows 32 bit build
- Move Linux binary distribution to a ubuntu 20 docker image
- Move to CLANG on windows 64

- Double-click now selects only one word at a time
- Undo/Redo now respond to keys set in the Keyboard Shortcut Editor
- Code editor now saves state for caret position, selection and search/replace/goto line on close
- Formula debugger now groups variables under user, shared and built-in sections that can be collapsed
- Debugger now always updates on code compilation
- Debugger UI buttons have accessability set
- Fixed a possible crash due to recursion in the debugger

# Other Lua Changes

- Added `pairs`, `unpack`, `next`, `type`, `tostring`, `tonumber`, `setmetatable`, `pcall` and `xpcall` functions to sandbox environment
- Added `string`, `table` function tables and `bit` module
- Added `print` function for console output
- Improved error reporting for script compilation

# Python Wrapper

- Explicity set process input to false in the python wrapper
- Ability to load a wavetable into a patch in python

# Infrastructure and Code Factoring

- merge support for linux builds using musl rather than glibc
- Move the oscillator unison/drift/character support to sst-basic-blocks submodule
- Remove old unused AllPassFilter code
- Move Reverb2, Treemonster, Nimbus, RotarySpeaker to sst-effects
- Update liajutlib build environment to be more uniform across platforms, use upstream build system
- Update eurorack sub-library to build with MSVC Clang
- Remove dependency on libsamplerate
- Increase the MSVC stack size in debug builds to allow formula modulator tests to be reliable
- Switch to not using simde native aliases to accomodate arm64ec. Apply macro-based-violence to the code
- Clean up a collection of issues identified by static analysis tool **insert link to tool**

# Other UI/UX changes
