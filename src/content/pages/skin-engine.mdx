title: Developing Surge Skins
---

As we approach Surge 1.8.0 we have done a substantial upgrade to our skin engine. This document covers the skin engine
as of the latest nightly and is automatically generated from the Nightly Tutorial skins.

# Before you begin

This document assumes a couple of things

1. You want to change the look and feel of the surge synthesier
2. You are comfortable making and editing SVG documents, specifying colors in RGB, thinking about UI elements
3. You can create SVGs, edit XML files, and generally manipulate files and directories on your system of choice
4. You can run the Surge synth in an environment on your computer

Moreover, to use the features here (until we release 1.8.0) we assume you have installed and are running the
Surge Nightly, as the features listed here are not in the far more rudimentary 1.7.1 skin engine.

This documentation is generated automatically from the tutorials which ship with the nightly. Any of these skins can
be run in surge by going to the skins menu and choosing the Tutorial skin.

And finally, we are approaching 1.8.0 but we aren't there. These tutorials aren't done, and neither are some of the tools
a skin designer would need in a final state. So if you are embarking on a skin now, thanks for your patience, and you
might want to chat with us on Discord. And of course, if you want to improve these tutorials, please just send in a
pull request!
