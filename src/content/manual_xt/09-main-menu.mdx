# Main Menu

You can find this menu in the bottom-right corner of Surge XT's interface.
Clicking it reveals various configuration options.

Note: Some of these options are also present at the top of the user interface for easier access
(see [Status Area](#status-area)).

This menu can also be opened by right-clicking anywhere on the user interface where there are no controls.

### Zoom

The **Zoom** option can be extremely useful on certain monitors and configurations.

In its sub-menu there are various options to change the scale of the whole user-interface to a certain size.
Keep in mind that it will not let you change it to any size, as there is an upper limit depending on your screen resolution.

When a new instance of Surge is loaded, its zoom will be set to default size. To change this value,
go back in this sub-menu and select the option "Set [zoom %] as default", or "Set default zoom to ..." then enter the desired value.

### Skins

This is where the UI skin can be chosen. Surge XT comes with two factory skins: **Classic** and **Dark**.

![Illustration 62: Classic skin](./images/manual-xt/Pictures/surge.png)

![Illustration 63: Dark skin](./images/manual-xt/Pictures/surge_dark.png)

Additional skins are available to download from our [**skin library**](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/skin-library).
Here is one of them, the **Royal** skin by [Voger Design](https://vogerdesign.com/):

From there you can also reload the current skin and rescan the skins folder. You can even configure if the colors of
context menus follow the OS light/dark mode settings, or are applied from the currently loaded skin.

From there, you can also reload the current skin, rescan skins, open the current skin folder location, open the skin
inspector and open the skin development guide.

If you would like to get on board with the skin engine and developing skins,
see the documentation on [developing Surge XT skins](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/skin-manual.html).

### Value Displays

-   **High Precision Value Readouts** - Allows value popups that appear when tweaking parameters to show more digits
    after the decimal point (6 digits). This can be useful in some more advanced and precise scenarios.

-   **Modulation value readout shows bounds** - Allows the value popup that appears when applying modulation and
    adjusting its amount to a parameter to show more values, such as the relative range in the negative direction,
    and both absolute minimum and maximum values underneath.

-   **Show value readout on mouse hover** - Allows you to enable or disable the gesture of hovering over a slider to
    display its value.

-   **Show ghosted LFO waveform reference** - Allows you to enable or disable the LFO waveform at full amplitude
    displayed with a dotted line in the LFO display area.

-   **Middle C** - Allows you to change the reference octave shown in popup displays of some frequency-related parameters,
    such as filter cutoff for instance. You can change Middle C to display either **C3**, **C4** or **C5**.

### Data Folders

In this sub-menu, there are a couple of options regarding user data and patches.

**Open factory data folder...** - This opens the location where factory patches, wavetables and other
configuration files are stored.

**Open user data folder...** - This option opens the location where custom patches saved by the user will be stored.

**Set custom user data folder...** - This allows you to change where user patches will be saved.

**Rescan all data folders** - This option can be useful after importing patches created by someone else,
after transferring user patches to another computer, or after downloading patches from the internet.

### Mouse Behavior

This sub-menu contains options allowing you to change the sensitivity of the mouse when moving sliders.
While _Legacy_ is used by default, the other 3 options range from _Slow_ (more granular) to _Exact_
(as fast as the mouse pointer). Also, there is an option to keep showing the mouse pointer on the
screen when dragging on a control.

Touchscreen mode automatically sets the mouse options to give the user the best experience when using Surge
on a touch screen.

### Patch Settings

This is where you can configure what appears by default in the **Author** and **Comment** fields when saving a patch. \
You can also set the currently loaded patch as the default patch, append the original author
name to modified patches or not, and configure tuning and tuning mapping when loading patches. \
Finally, there are options to export the currently loaded patch as an HTML file, either containing
all parameters, or only the ones that aren't set to their default value.

### Workflow

-   **Remember tab positions per scene** - Remember tab positions (for example, currently selected oscillator or
    LFO currently shown in the LFO editor) separately for each scene or unified in the whole synth.

-   **Load MSEG snap state from patch** - Tells Surge XT if it should load the MSEG snap parameters from the saved patch or
    keep the existing settings.

-   **Previous/next patch constrained to current category** - Turn this option off to allow the previous/next
    patch arrow buttons in the patch browser area to automatically switch categories after hitting the beginning or end
    of one.

-   **Retain patch search results after loading** - Prevents the search results box from closing after loading a searched
    patch. Useful if you want to preview all patches corresponding to your search query.

-   **Confirm patch loading if unsaved changes exist** - When this option is enabled, Surge XT will ask if you
    would like to save the currently edited patch before loading the next one.

-   **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Enables of disables the keyboard shortcuts.

-   **Edit keyboard shortcuts...** - Opens a window containing a list of all the available keyboard shortcuts in Surge XT.
    This is also where you can customize all those shortcuts and enable or disable them individually.

-   **Shift + F10 and Edit parameter value shortcuts** - If the first of the two options is enabled, the **Shift + F10**
    keyboard shortcut and **Enter** key will allow you to access a control's context menu.
    If the **Follow mouse hover focus** option is enabled, it will also follow the mouse cursor.

-   **Virtual keyboard** - Toggle this option to show or hide the virtual on-screen keyboard at the
    bottom of the user interface. The virtual keyboard also includes a pitch bend and modulation wheel control.

-   **Oscilloscope...** - This opens a window that displays an oscilloscope or a spectrum analyser. See [Oscilloscope](#oscilloscope) for more information.

### Accessibility

-   **Set all recommended accessibility options** - Enables all the accessibility options found right below. Useful for quickly setting up
    Surge XT to work with screen readers.

-   **Send additional accessibility announcements** - Sends more information when using accessibility features, such as
    patch or category changes via the arrow buttons below the patch browser.

-   **Announce patch browser entries** - This is a Windows only option.
    If enabled, the narrator will announce the currently selected row in the patch browser.

-   **Add sub-menus for modulation menu items** - Makes the modulation options found in the context menu of controls work as a
    sub-menu with discrete Clear, Mute and Edit entries, alongside being able to directly click on the corresponding icons.

-   **Focus modulator editor on "Add modulation from" actions** - After using the context menu option ["Add modulation from"](#add-modulation-from),
    the modulator that is used to modulate the targeted control will be displayed in the modulation editor.

### MPE Settings

**MPE** stands for **MIDI Polyphonic Expression**. It can be enabled or disabled in its sub-menu.
The current and default pitch bend range can be changed here as well. Finally, you can also configure
the MPE pitch bend smoothing amount.

### MIDI Settings

This sub-menu contains options for MIDI mappings.

#### Controller Smoothing

This sub-menu contains options to set the amount of desired MIDI controller smoothing.

#### Sustain Pedal in Mono Mode

-   **Sustain pedal holds all notes (no note off retrigger)** - If sustain is engaged and multiple notes are hit then
    held one after the other, Surge XT will stay on the latest note when releasing it instead of switching to the previous
    note.
-   **Sustain pedal allows note off retrigger** - If sustain is engaged and multiple notes are hit then held one after
    the other, Surge XT will switch to the previous note when the latest note is released.

#### Use MIDI channels 2 and 3 to play scenes individually

Playing MIDI channels 2 or 3 when this option is unchecked will not play scene A or B individually.

#### Ignore MIDI Program Change messages

Self-explanatory. You probably want to turn this on in most situations.

#### Save MIDI mapping as...

This allows you to save the current MIDI mapping. The newly created profile will appear in this menu under the two top options.

#### Set current MIDI mapping as default

When a new instance of Surge XT is opened, it will load this MIDI mapping by default if you select this option.

#### Clear current MIDI mapping

As its name suggests, this option clears the existing MIDI mapping in Surge XT and resets it back to default.

#### Show Current MIDI Mapping

This opens up an HTML file listing the currently loaded MIDI mapping.

### Tuning

These options are also present in the Tuning menu at the top of the interface. See [Microtuning](#microtuning) for
detailed explanations on the tuning implementation within Surge XT.
