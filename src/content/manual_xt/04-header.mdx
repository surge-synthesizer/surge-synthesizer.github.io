# Header

![Illustration 7: Header section](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/header.png)

In the header, you can select and manage patches, select scene modes, configure tuning, and control effects and output.

## Scene Select and Scene Mode

![Illustration 8: Scene select and scene mode](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/scene_select.png)

Select **Scene** buttons **A** or **B** to select a scene. The selected scene displays below.

To copy or paste a scene, right-click on **Scene** buttons **A** or **B** to display the context menu, then select **Copy** or **Paste**.

To select a **Scene Mode**, select:

- **Single** to play only the selected scene A or B.
- **Key Split** to play Scene A for notes below the **Split** key, and
  Scene B for notes including and above the **Split** key.
- **Channel Split** to play Scene A for channels below and including the
  **Split** MIDI channel, and Scene B for channels above the **Split** MIDI channel.
- **Dual** to play both scenes A and B.

If you disable **MPE** and select **Scene Mode** **Key Split** or **Dual**, channel 1 and channels 4 to 15 play the selected **Scene Mode**. Channel 2 plays only Scene A and channel 3 plays only Scene B.

### Polyphony limit

If you try to play more voices than the polyphony limit, Surge XT will stop a playing voice to make room for the new one. To change how Surge stops voices at the polyphony limit, see [Play Mode options](#other-sound-generation-parameters).

To change the polyphony limit, drag the **Poly** control up or down. **Poly** displays a count of playing voices.

## Patch Browser

![Illustration 9: Patch browser](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/patchbrowser.png)

### Navigation

To cycle through patches, select the **Patch** arrow buttons.

To cycle through patch categories, select the **Category** arrow buttons.

To select a random patch, middle-click the **Patch** or **Category** arrow buttons.

To select a patch in the current category, right-click the **Patch Browser** area where the patch name displays, then select a patch.

To list all available patches, select the **Patch Browser** area where the patch name displays. In the pop-up, patch categories display in columns: 

- **Factory Patches** were created by authors of Surge 1.6. Select a category, then a patch.
- **Third Party Patches** were contributed by users and the Surge Synth Team. Select a creator name, then a category, then a patch.
- **User Patches** are your own patches. You can choose how to categorize these patches.
  **Favorites** are patches where you selected the **Favorite** heart icon.

At the bottom, there is an option to
[download additional content](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Additional-Content).

By default, to help prevent you loosing an unsaved patch by switching patches, a confirmation dialog will open, asking
you if you still want to proceed. You can turn off this warning by checking the _Don't ask me again_ box, or by
disabling the appropriate option in the [Workflow](#workflow) category found in the [main menu](#main-menu).
A modified or unsaved patch name will show an asterisk in the patch name area.

You can also directly load patches (.fxp) by dragging and dropping them anywhere over the Surge XT interface.

There is also an option in the patch menu to set the current patch as the default one to be loaded when
opening a new instance of Surge XT.

Furthermore, the patch menu allows you to rename or delete a patch. Those options will only appear if you have a
non-factory patch loaded in the synth.

Finally, the patch browser also support program changes via MIDI, which you can learn more about [here](#program-change-messages).

### Searching Patches

To search patches by name, simply click on the magnifier glass icon to the left of the patch name area.
You may see Surge XT first update the patch database before being able to type in your search query.

You can also search for patches by **author** or **category** by typing "AUTHOR=" or "CATEGORY=", followed by
your search query. There is also a shorthand for these keywords, you can type "AUTH=" or "CAT=" instead.

If the **Retain patch search results after loading** option is enabled in the [Workflow](#workflow) category found in
the main menu, holding Ctrl while selecting your desired search result with your mouse or while pressing enter will
close the search results.

### The Save Dialog

![Illustration 10: Save dialog](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/store_dialog.png)

Clicking the **Save** button of the patch browser opens the save dialog.
This is where you name your new patch and choose which category it
should belong in. You can also create a new category manually here as
well. The patches you save will end up in the user section at the bottom
of the patch menu. The save dialog also provides text fields for the name of the patch creator,
license, and comments.

Note: You can display the comments of a particular patch by hovering over the patch name area with your mouse.

Holding down the **Shift** key when saving a patch will automatically overwrite an existing patch, which
bypasses the dialog asking you for an overwrite confirmation.

### Favoriting Patches

Adding a patch to your favorites list is as easy as pressing the heart icon to the right of the patch name area.
Right-clicking on that same icon will allow you to access the favorite patches list.

## Status Area

![Illustration 11: Status area](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/status.png)

This area is meant to be a quick access to some of Surge XT's features that are also present in the Menu.
(see [Main Menu](#main-menu))

The **MPE** and **Tune** buttons are for quickly enabling/disabling those features in the current Surge XT instance.
Right-clicking on one of these buttons will reveal more options which are also present in sub-menus under the Menu button as well.
Left-clicking the Tune button while Surge XT is in its default tuning will also simply open the menu. See [Microtuning](#microtuning) for more information.

## FX Bypass, Character, Global Volume

![Illustration 12: FX bypass, character and global volume](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/fx_bypass.png)

**FX Bypass** lets you quickly hear what a patch sounds like without the effect-units. (see [Effects](#effects))

-   **Off** – Bypass is disabled, all effects are active.
-   **Send** – The send effects are bypassed.
-   **Send + Global** - The send and global effects are bypassed.
-   **All** – All effects are bypassed.

**Character** controls the amount of high-frequency content present in
most of Surge XT's oscillator algorithms. Available choices are Warm, Neutral
and Bright.

**Global Volume** controls the last gain stage before the output.
You can choose to hard clip the global output either at **+18 dBFS** (default) or **0 dBFS**
by right-clicking on it.

### Level Meter

The level meter above the global volume shows the output level, and will become red if it goes
above 0 dBFS. If you right-click on the level meter, you will find options to open the [oscilloscope](#oscilloscope),
and also to display CPU usage.
