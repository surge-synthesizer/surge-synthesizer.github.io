# User Interface Basics

Surge XT displays four main sections: header, scene controls, modulation and routing, and effects.

_The four sections of Surge XT._

## The Scene Concept

Every patch in Surge XT contains two scenes (A & B) and an effects section.
A scene is similar to a traditional synthesizer patch that stores all the information used to synthesize a voice.
In a single patch, you can play a single scene, layer two scenes, or split the key range between two scenes.
See [Scene Select and Scene Mode](#scene-select-and-scene-mode).

## Audio Outputs

When loaded into a DAW, each instance of Surge XT has **3 audio outputs**:

- Stereo Out
- Scene A Out
- Scene B Out

If your host allows, you can route and process those outputs separately.

## Sliders and Controls

Surge XT parameters display as number fields, value fields, buttons, button groups, or sliders.

If you select anywhere in the slider control, it enters drag mode.

Slider movement:

- **Left-drag** moves the slider
- **Shift + Left-drag** moves the slider with fine control
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Left-drag** moves the slider in steps
- **Scroll Wheel** moves the slider 10% of its range
- **Shift + Scroll Wheel** moves the slider in small steps

Other slider actions:

- If you have Alt pressed when you release a left-drag, the slider snaps back to its initial position
- **Double left-click** resets the parameter to its default value
- **Right-click** displays the context menu
- **Hover** displays its value


### Undo and Redo

To undo or redo your latest changes, select the curved arrow buttons to the left of the **Save** button below the [Patch Browser](#patch-browser). You can also use default keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl + Z to undo, and Ctrl + Y to redo.

### Parameter Context Menu

To display a parameter context menu, right-click.

![Illustration 3: Slider context menu](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/slider_context_menu.png)

#### Name and Contextual Help

For help with a parameter, select the **?** option, or hover the parameter and press F1.

#### Edit Value

Select **Edit value** then enter a value. There is no need to enter the unit of the entered value. Press Enter to commit the change. To exit without committing the change, press Escape or focus elsewhere.

![Illustration 4: Type-in window](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/typein_window.png)

For a discrete parameter, like **Unison Voices** or a button row, select a value from its context menu.

#### Extend Range

You can extend the range of some parameters, like **Pitch**. Select **Extend range** from its context menu.

#### Tempo Sync

You can synchronize some parameters to the host tempo. Toggle **Tempo sync**. With **Tempo sync** enabled, a slider displays "TS".

**Note:** The **TS** display depends on the skin used.

#### Enabled

You can enable or disable some parameters. Toggle **Enabled**. A disabled slider displays faintly or has no handle.

#### Modulations

This section of the menu will appear if the right-clicked slider is being modulated by some modulation source(s) (if it has a blue tint).
See [Routing](#routing) for more information.

-   **Red X icon** - Clicking on this icon to the left of a modulation source will clear that modulation routing.
-   **Speaker icon** - Clicking on this will allow you to mute (bypass) a modulation source in the list. Simply click
    that icon again to unmute that source.
-   **Pencil icon** - This will bring up the modulation amount type-in window.
    Simply type-in the desired amount of modulation you want to apply to that parameter. See
    [Edit Value](#edit-value) for more information.

#### Add Modulation From

As its name suggests, this menu entry allows you to directly link a modulator to the right-clicked control.
All the available modulation sources are sorted in different categories so you can find the desired one easier.
Once a modulation source is chosen, a type-in window will appear, allowing you to enter the modulation amount you
want to apply.

#### Assign To MIDI CC

This option allows to assign the right-clicked parameter to any MIDI CC.

#### MIDI Learn

This is where you assign a MIDI controller to the desired slider. To abort MIDI learning on that parameter,
simply right-click again and the option will now become **Abort Parameter MIDI Learn**.

#### Clear learned MIDI

This option will be available if the selected parameter has already been MIDI learned. It allows you to clear that link (the
existing link MIDI CC number will be shown in parentheses).

#### VST3 Options

Finally, the VST3 version of Surge XT supports VST3 context menu items. Depending on the host,
there may be more or less options regarding automation, MIDI, or parameter values.
