# User interface basics

Surge XT displays four main sections: header, scene controls, modulation and routing, and effects.

_The four sections of Surge XT._

## <a name="the-scene-concept"></a>Scenes

Every patch in Surge XT contains two scenes (A & B) and an effects section.
A scene is similar to a traditional synthesizer patch that stores all the information used to synthesize a voice.
In a single patch, you can play a single scene, layer two scenes, or split the key range between two scenes.
See [Scene Select and Scene Mode](#scene-select-and-scene-mode).

## Audio Outputs

When loaded into a DAW, each instance of Surge XT has 3 audio outputs:

- Stereo Out
- Scene A Out
- Scene B Out

If your host allows, you can route and process those outputs separately.

## Sliders and controls

Surge XT parameters display as number fields, value fields, buttons, button groups, or sliders.

If you select anywhere in the slider control, it enters drag mode.

Slider movement:

- **Left-drag** moves the slider
- **Shift + Left-drag** moves the slider with fine control
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Left-drag** moves the slider in steps
- **Scroll Wheel** moves the slider 10% of its range
- **Shift + Scroll Wheel** moves the slider in small steps

Other slider actions:

- If you have Alt pressed when you release a left-drag, the slider snaps back to its initial position
- **Double Left-click** resets the parameter to its default value
- **Right-click** displays the context menu
- **Hover** displays its value


### Undo and Redo

To undo or redo your latest changes, select the curved arrow buttons to the left of the **Save** button
below the [Patch Browser](#patch-browser). You can also press Ctrl + Z to undo,
and Ctrl + Y to redo.

### Parameter context menu

To display a parameter context menu, right-click.

#### Name and contextual help

For help with a parameter, select the **?** option, or hover the parameter and press F1.

#### Edit Value

Select **Edit Value** then enter a value. There is no need to enter the unit of the entered value.
Press Enter to commit the change. To exit without committing the change, press Escape or focus elsewhere.

![Illustration 4: Type-in window](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/typein_window.png)

For a discrete parameter, like **Unison Voices** or a button row, select a value from its context menu.

#### Extend Range

You can extend the range of some parameters, like **Pitch**. Select **Extend Range** from its context menu.

#### Tempo Sync

You can synchronize some parameters to the host tempo. Toggle **Tempo Sync**. With **Tempo Sync** enabled,
a slider displays "TS".

**Note:** Skins can display **TS** differently.

#### Enabled

You can enable or disable some parameters. Toggle **Enabled** in its context menu. A disabled slider
displays dimmed or has no handle.

#### Modulations

Surge XT can use a modulation source to adjust a parameter value. If a modulation is active, the slider
track highlights, and its **Modulations** section displays in its context menu. Each row is a modulation.
See [Routing](#routing). For a modulation row:

- To clear a modulation routing, select the red **X** icon.
- To toggle bypassing a modulation routing, select the speaker icon.
- To edit the modulation amount, select the pencil icon and type a value. See [Edit Value](#edit-value).

#### Add Modulation From

To select a new modulation source, select **Add Modulation From**, then select a modulation source and
enter a modulation value.

#### Assign To MIDI CC

To assign the parameter a MIDI controller:

1. Select **Assign to MIDI CC** from the parameter context menu.
2. Select a MIDI controller code. You can select codes 0 to 127, but some codes are reserved for other uses.
3. Optionally, to change the listened MIDI channel, select **Assign to MIDI CC** > **MIDI Channel**, and
select a new channel or **Omni**.

You can select only one assigned or learned MIDI controller for a parameter.

#### MIDI Learn

To assign a MIDI controller to a parameter, select **MIDI Learn** from the parameter context menu, then
move a controller on a connected MIDI device.

To exit MIDI learn, select **Abort MIDI Learn** from the parameter context menu.

You can select only one assigned or learned MIDI controller for a parameter.

#### Clear learned MIDI

The assigned or learned MIDI controller displays next to **Clear Learned MIDI** in the parameter context menu.

To clear the assigned or learned MIDI controller, select **Clear Learned MIDI**.

#### VST3 options

If you use the VST version of Surge XT, options from your host display at the end of the context menu.
These options might help with automation, MIDI, or parameter values.
