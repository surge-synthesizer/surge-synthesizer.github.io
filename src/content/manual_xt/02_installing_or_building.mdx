# Installing or Building Surge XT

Download the Surge XT installer from [https://surge-synthesizer.github.io](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io).


## Windows

On the Windows platform, Surge XT installs optionally as:

- 32-bit VST3, with filename `Surge XT.vst3`
- 64-bit VST3, with filename `Surge XT.vst3`
- CLAP plug-in instrument, with filename `Surge XT.clap`
- Standalone executable, with filename `Surge XT.exe`

System Requirements:

- Windows 7 or newer
- A reasonably fast CPU (Pentium 4/Athlon 64 or above)
- At least 4GB of RAM
- VST-compatible host application

To use the 64-bit version on Windows you also need:

- A CPU supporting the x64 (AMD64/EM64T) instruction set
- A 64-bit version of Windows
- An application to host 64-bit VST plug-ins

VST3 and CLAP versions of the plug-in install to default plug-in locations.
If your host application does not find Surge XT, check that your application supports VST3 or CLAP,
and make it scan for plugins.

### Windows portable mode

- If Surge XT is installed alongside a `SurgeXTData` folder, Surge XT will use that for factory data rather than the default `%PROGRAMDATA%\Surge XT`.
- If Surge XT is installed alongside a `SurgeXTUserData` folder, Surge XT will use that for user data rather than the default `%DOCUMENTS%\Surge XT`.
- The [About screen](#about-surge-xt) displays the folders Surge XT uses.


## macOS

On macOS, Surge XT installs as a 64-bit Plug-in Instrument for the Audio Unit (AU), VST3, and CLAP plug-in interfaces,
and as a standalone application.

System Requirements:

- Mac OS X 10.11 or newer
- A 64-bit x86 Intel or ARM Apple Silicon CPU
- At least 4GB of RAM
- 64-bit AU or VST-compatible host application

To install Surge XT, run the packaged installer. You have the option to install AU `Surge XT.component`, VST3,
and CLAP, along with factory patches and wavetables. The packaged installer installs Surge XT for all users
of your system.


## Linux

On Linux, Surge XT is available as a 64-bit VST3 and CLAP as a **deb** and **RPM** package.
It is also offered as a standalone application.

The system requirements can be hard to determine, as there are many Linux distributions, and other factors.

The installation package on the **Surge XT website** is a Debian package.

The distribution package is built on Ubuntu 18.04.

A list of required packages is listed in the source and in the deb file.

**Note:** Some actions in Surge XT use Alt + Drag or the scroll wheel, which can conflict with the desktop
environment. To solve that issue, disable the global gesture in the desktop environment.


## Building from Source

To build Surge XT from source, see
[our Github repository](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge).


## Installing Alongside Older Versions

Surge and Surge XT are different plug-ins. This means that you can install Surge XT alongside Surge 1.9 or earlier.
Keep Surge 1.9 installed to open projects that use older versions of Surge.


## Standalone Version Options

If you are running Surge XT as a standalone executable, options at the top-left:
- configure MIDI and audio inputs and outputs
- save and open state files for the synth
- reset Surge XT to the default state

The **BPM** setting is to the left of the virtual keyboard at the bottom of the window.
This sets the tempo for the [Tempo-Sync](#tempo-sync) option in the context menus of most time-related parameters.


## Locations

**Note**: You can change these locations in the Surge XT main menu. See [Data Folders](#data-folders).

**Warning**: If you reinstall Surge XT, you will lose any changes you made to the content of the factory folder,
including custom patches and skins.
The Surge XT installer never changes files the user area, so save your files there.

### Windows

The patch library and wavetables are at `C:ProgramData\Surge XT`.

The user patches are at `C:\Users\your username\My Documents\Surge XT`.

### macOS

The patch library and wavetables are at `/Library/Application Support/Surge XT`.

The user patches are at `~/Documents/Surge XT`.

### Linux

The patch library and wavetables are at `/usr/share/surge-xt` with a standard install.

The user patches are at `~/Documents/Surge XT`. Surge XT creates this directory when you store a patch
or change the user default settings for the first time.


## Playing Your First Note

Surge XT is best used with a [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation), or a physical device
like a keyboard. To get started, you can open the virtual keyboard from the main menu > **Workflow** > **Virtual Keyboard**,
or Alt + K. See [Workflow](#workflow).
