# Getting Started

[Manual for Surge 1.9](/manual)

Thank you for using **Surge XT**\!

Surge XT is a virtual synthesizer originally released as "Surge" into
open source by creator Claes Johanson in September 2018. Since then, it is maintained by a group of volunteers.

This first section is intended to give you a brief overview of some concepts
that are specific to this synthesizer and an introduction on how to navigate,
manipulate, and use Surge XT to its full potential.

For detailed information regarding the synthesis engine and other advanced technical
specifications and options of this synthesizer, there is a second section dedicated to
[Technical Reference](#technical-reference).

Note that most of the images and descriptions in this manual are made with the Classic skin in mind, as it's the
default skin used when first loading Surge XT.

Finally, for more tips and tricks, tutorials, and to download additional content, you can also take a look at
[Surge's wiki](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki).

Feel free to visit the Surge Synth Team Discord server [here](https://discord.com/invite/spGANHw) if you have questions
about Surge XT, want to help in developing it further or if you come across any bugs or other issues.
