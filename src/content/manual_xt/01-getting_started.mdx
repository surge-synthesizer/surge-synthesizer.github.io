# Getting started

If you're using Surge 1.9, use the [Manual for Surge 1.9](/manual).

Surge XT is a virtual synthesizer originally released as "Surge" as open source by creator Claes Johanson in September 2018. Since then, it's maintained by the Surge Synth Team, a group of volunteers.

This manual has main sections:
- [Installing or building](#installing-or-building-surge-xt)
- [Interface and using Surge XT](#user-interface-basics)
- [Accessibility](#accessibility)
- [Technical Reference](#technical-reference), with specifications and details of the synthesis engine.

For tutorials, tips, and more content, see the [Surge wiki](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki).

To ask questions, report bugs or issues, or help develop Surge XT, visit the [Surge Synth Team Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/spGANHw).

Most of the images and descriptions use the default **Classic** skin, and this manual uses macOS conventions (**Title Case**) for labels in the UI, and Windows keyboard labels.
