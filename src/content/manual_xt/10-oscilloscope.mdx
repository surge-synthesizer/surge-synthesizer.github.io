# Oscilloscope

Surge XT offers a basic real-time waveform and spectrum display to help with your sound design. After opening the Oscilloscope window,
you can choose between either a **Waveform Display** (oscilloscope) or **Spectrum Display**.

In both modes, you can select to view only the left or right stereo channels or both simultaneously using the **L** and **R** buttons
towards the top-right of the display. If both are selected, the results are averaged between the two channels. If neither are selected,
the scope will be frozen in its current position until a channel is selected.

## Waveform Display

The waveform display is based on the well-known oscilloscope plugin s(M)exoscope. Big thanks to [Bram@Smartelectronix](https://github.com/bdejong/smartelectronix) for open-sourcing this useful tool!

The oscilloscope has four trigger modes:

-   **Freerun** - Enabled by the default. The display never erases and immediately starts writing again at the left as soon as the waveform reaches the right side of the display area.

-   **Rising Edge** This mode retriggers the display every time a waveform peak rises past a certain level. This level is set with the **Trigger Level** slider. Drag this slider to set the retrigger level above or below the zero crossing. The retrigger level will be indicated by a horizontal white line on the display.

-   **Falling Edge** Identical to Rising mode, except that the display retriggers only when the waveform falls past the retrigger level.

-   **Internal Trigger** - Retriggers the display at a frequency set by the **Internal Trigger Freq** slider. Values are measured in Hz, and retrigger rates range from as infrequently as 0.441 Hz to as often as 139.4 times a second. This mode is useful if you only want to watch a certain part of a waveform.

In all of the above modes, the **Retrigger Threshold** slider determines how soon the display can be retriggered after the last trigger. This threshold is measured in samples, from 1 to 10000.
For example, if the Retrigger Threshold is set to 450, then the display will not retrigger unless at least 450 samples have passed through the display since the last retrigger. This is useful if you absolutely need to see a certain number of samples in your waveform before it refreshes.

There are also two other sliders that control the display:

-   **Time Scaling** - Controls the number of pixels per sample. The lower the number, the finer the resolution of the waveform. When you change this slider, you can see the time scale marks on the display change to represent the new timescale.

-   **Amplitude Scaling** - Controls the amplitude of the waveform in the display. If your waveform appears too thin, turn it up. If your waveform is cut off at the top or bottom of the display, turn it down.

Finally, there are three options you can use to customize the oscilloscope's behavior even further:

-   **DC Block** - Enabling this option will automatically compensate for DC offset, if your waveform is too far off the zero crossing line for example.

-   **Freeze** - This button can be used to freeze the waveform on the display.

-   **Sync Redraw** - When activated, Surge XT will only update waveform data when the plugin's internal graphic buffer is full (as opposed to in real-time). In other words, turn this on to slow down how often the display refreshes, and adjust the Time Scaling slider again to find the right speed.

## Spectrum Display

The spectrum display provides a simple instantaneous view of the frequency domain of the current
synthesizer output. It is done using FFT, with a fixed block size of 8192 samples.

The display is updated with new data extremely quickly as it streams in. It interpolates between the
prior FFT block and the new block over the course of (8196 / sample size) seconds. Once this very
brief smoothing period passes, all new data is displayed.

The spectrum display can be controlled by a few parameters:

-   **Min Level** - Controls the lowest value that the display will show. Increase it in order to scale
    the display to your taste or your data.

-   **Max dB** - Controls the highest value that the display will show. Decrease it in order to
    scale the display to your taste or your data.

-   **Decay Rate** - Controls the time it takes for the spectrum's amplitude to decay after a decrease in
    amplitude.

-   **Freeze** - This button can be used to freeze the spectral content on the display.
