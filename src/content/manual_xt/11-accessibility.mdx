# Accessibility

The Surge XT user interface can be completely navigated from the keyboard. Pressing Tab will allow you to move through all controls
in the user interface, while pressing the up and down arrow keys will let you adjust them. Just like holding Shift or Control/Command
while moving a slider with the mouse lets you make more precise adjustments, holding these modifiers while pressing the
arrow keys will have a similar effect. Pressing Home, End or Delete will let you set a control to its maximum, minimum and default
value respectively. Finally, pressing Shift+F10 or the Applications key on any control will open its right-click menu.

With the exception of Tab, the other keys mentioned here need to be turned on before they can be used. If you press one of these keys
with the shortcuts turned off, you will be asked whether you want to turn them on. Alternatively, they can be turned on by checking the
**Use keyboard shortcuts** option in the [Workflow](#workflow) section of the menu. A number of additional shortcuts are available
which allow you to quickly open specific dialogs, change patches or save your work and more.

In addition to full keyboard support, Surge XT is compatible with screen reader software on both Mac and Windows. This means that as
you navigate through the interface, the screen reader will give you full speech and braille feedback on the control that’s focused
and what its value is. You can also navigate the interface using your screen reader’s review commands.

For additional help on using Surge with specific Screen Readers, refer to <a href="../accessibility">this page</a>.
