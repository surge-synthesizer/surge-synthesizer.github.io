voice. Not all processing elements of the voice are shown in the
diagram.

### LFOs

Each voice has 6 configurable LFOs and each scene has an
additional 6 configurable LFOs, making each voice effectively capable of receiving modulation from
a total of 12 LFOs.

### Modulation Routing Details

How the modulation routing works internally isn't something you normally
have to think about when using Surge XT. Just activate the modulation mode
with the desired source and see which of the sliders that become blue.
Nonetheless, it is useful to know which limitations are present and why.

![Illustration 69: Modulation routing behind the scenes](./images/manual-xt/Pictures/illu19.png)

_Modulation routing behind the scenes_

The thing to remember is that voice modulation sources can't
modulate scene parameters, global/effect parameters or parameters from scene LFOs, since these are two
distinctly different modulation paths. Other than that it should be pretty straightforward.

## Oscillator Algorithms

Surge XT provides 12 different oscillator algorithms, each capable of
generating sound in different ways with a different set of controls.
They're not just different waveforms.

### Classic

The Classic oscillator algorithm consists of a main oscillator that can
generate a pulse wave, a sawtooth wave, a dual-saw wave or anything in
between.

A sub-oscillator provides a pulse-wave one octave below the main
oscillator. Changing the pulse-width of the sub-oscillator does affect
the main oscillator as well, as they will both change levels at the same
time except that the main oscillator does it twice as often.

The Classic algorithm is also capable of oscillator self-sync. Note that
the sub-oscillator will be used as the base-pitch for the sync.

The algorithm provides unison at the oscillator-level with up to 16
instances. Unlike the Wavetable oscillator, the cost of unison in terms
of CPU usage for the Classic oscillator is quite modest. The unison
oscillator voices are affected by the scene level Osc Drift parameter
independently.

### Modern

The Modern oscillator algorithm is a multi-waveform oscillator which creates pulse, 
triangle, saw and sine waveforms with unison and sub-oscillator capabilities. 
It is based on the differentiated polynomial waveform algorithm, from 
[this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juhan-Nam/publication/224557976_Alias-Suppressed_Oscillators_Based_on_Differentiated_Polynomial_Waveforms/links/573f274d08ae9ace84133dc9/Alias-Suppressed-Oscillators-Based-on-Differentiated-Polynomial-Waveforms.pdf).
The pulse, triangle and sawtooth waveforms are clean and result in very low aliasing, while the sine produces some 
additional harmonics.

Three parameters labeled **Sawtooth**, **Pulse** and **Triangle** control relative mixes of those waveforms, while
the **Width** parameter controls the pulse width for the Pulse wave. **Sync** offsets the pitch of the oscillator against the pitch of the internal reference oscillator
while resetting the phase of the main oscillator to the phase of the reference oscillator, to achieve typical hard sync effects.
Unison controls work like in other Surge XT oscillators.

#### Third Waveform Parameter

The third waveform parameter (labeled "Triangle" by default) is special in that
it has several waveform options to choose from. If you right-click it, you can see
that it can generate a triangle wave, a sine wave, or a square wave. This control
can also become a sub-oscillator, playing at half the frequency of the other two waveforms.
Importantly, in sub-oscillator mode, the third waveform does **not** participate in unison,
which is in contrast to the Sub Mix parameter in Classic oscillator. Finally,
there is also an option for the sub-oscillator to bypass hard syncing against the internal reference oscillator.

### Wavetable

A wavetable in Surge XT consists of up to 512 single-cycle waveforms (frames), each of which can consist of up to 4096 samples.
Using the **Morph** parameter it is possible to sweep across the waveforms
in the wavetable.

![Illustration 70: Wavetable](./images/manual-xt/Pictures/tech_wavetable.png)

The individual waves are equidistant in the table. When the shape
setting is between two individual waves, they will be mixed to ensure
smooth travel. You can't edit the wavetable contents directly within
Surge XT, but it is possible to generate custom wavetables with external
software.

Surge XT can also import wavetables containing a **clm** block to indicate loop size (as used by Serum),
a **cue** block (as used by various products including Native Instruments) and a **smpl** block.
Wavetable files without loop information are loaded as one-shots.

This effectively lets you import various wavetables from other products such as **Serum**.
All those 3rd party wavetables that have been tested in Surge XT have been reported to work flawlessly.

To import custom wavetables, use the wavetable selection bar at the bottom of the oscillator display. This is where you can also
[download additional wavetable content](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Additional-Content).

Alternatively, you can simply drag-and-drop any compatible wavetable file anywhere over the Surge interface to load it.

You can even create your own wavetables for Surge using [wt-tool](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Creating-Wavetables-For-Surge) or [WaveEdit](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Creating-Wavetables-With-WaveEdit).

Once a wavetable is loaded, you can also export it using the wavetable selection bar.

Then, by modulating the **Morph** parameter, it is possible to create motion,
dynamic response to playing and sonic variation. If you want to select an exact frame, drag the slider while holding
down Ctrl/Cmd, which allows you to snap to exact values in the table, useful for switching between distinct
shapes, for example.

What real-life property, if any, the **Morph** parameter is supposed to mirror depend on
each wavetable. Common cases are:

-   Analyzed from sounds that evolve over time. The behavior can be
    recreated by letting shape increase over time by modulation. It's
    the most common among the analyzed wavetables.
-   Analyzed from static sounds over different pitches to capture the
    formant shift of a sound. The behavior can be recreated by
    modulating shape by the keytrack modsource.
-   A parameter of a mathematical equation.

In the end it's just a set of data and Surge XT doesn't care how it was
generated, all that matters is how it sounds.

The Wavetable oscillator has some interesting sonic characteristics. It
outputs the waveform in a stair-stepped fashion, making no attempts to
'smooth the steps' in the process, but does so in a manner that is
completely band-limited. This makes it similar in sound to 1980s era
wave-table synths and samplers which didn't use resampling but had
dedicated D/A-converters for each voice instead and changed the pitch by
varying the sample rate of the individual D/As.

The fact that the steps aren't smoothed causes an artifact known as
harmonic aliasing. This is not to be confused with inharmonic aliasing
which sounds somewhat similar to an AM-radio being tuned and is
generally nasty. Instead, this artifact will cause the harmonics of the
waveform to repeat themselves and fill up the entire audible spectra
even at low pitches, just like a square-wave would, preventing the
waveform from sounding dull. As this artifact is completely harmonic it
is also musically pleasing. Nonetheless, it may sound a bit out of place
on very smooth waveforms but the effect can be filtered out by a
lowpass filter in the filter block if desired. Some of the wave-tables,
such as the regular triangle wave, are large enough for this artifact to
never appear in the normally used range for this specific reason.

The important thing is that just like most other oscillators in Surge XT,
it doesn't output any inharmonic aliasing whatsoever or any audible
levels of interpolation-noise, two artifacts which has played a big part
in giving digital synthesizers a bad name.

### Window

The Window oscillator is another shot at wavetable
synthesis that is quite different from the previous wavetable algorithm.

The wave, which can be any wavetable included with Surge XT, is multiplied
by a second waveform, the window, which can be one of 9 waveform types
that are specifically made for the window oscillator. The formant
parameter controls the pitch of the wave independently of the window,
but as the wave is always restarted with the window, the pitch will
remain the same. Instead, the timbre of the sound will change
dramatically, much depending on which window is selected.

Unlike the Wavetable algorithm, the Window oscillator uses a more
traditional resampling approach which doesn't result in harmonic
aliasing.

### Sine

Quite unsurprisingly, this oscillator generates a sine waveform. However, there's a number of other interesting things this oscillator can do!

### FM2

![Illustration 71: FM2 modulation matrix](./images/manual-xt/Pictures/FM2.png)

FM2 provides a miniature FM synthesizer voice in an oscillator that is
specifically tailored towards making nice and musical FM sounds. A
single sine carrier is modulated by two sine modulators, whose ratios to
the carrier are always integer thus the resulting waveform is always
cyclic. However, **M1/2 Offset** lets you offset the modulators slightly in
an absolute fashion, creating an evolving and pleasing detune
effect.

### FM3

![Illustration 72: FM3 modulation matrix](./images/manual-xt/Pictures/FM3.png)

As a contrast to FM2, FM3 is the algorithm of choice for scraping paint
off the walls. The modulators have a larger range, the ratios can be
non-integer and there's a third modulator which has its rate set as an
absolute frequency.

### String

The String oscillator uses a physical modeling technique where excitation sources
are sent into a tuned delay line with feedback, with various filters inline
(based on the original Karplus-Strong algorithm). The oscillator runs two strings
at all times which can be detuned from each other and individually damped.

To make the model create sound, you need to excite it. We have two classes of
excitation modes, **Burst** and **Constant**. In Burst mode, the delay line is loaded with a pattern
before a note is played, and then no further signal is added to the oscillator.
Think of this as emulating a plucked string. In Constant mode, the delay
line is also pre-loaded, but the signal continues to be applied for as long as you hold the key.
Think of this as emulating a bowed string. In almost all cases, Continuous excitation modes would be used
along with modulation of **Exciter Level** parameter, in order to emulate bow pressure, and so on.

Exciter modes provide various waveforms - noise, pink noise, ramp, etc. - which you can use to excite the strings,
leading to different timbres. Surge XT's audio input can also be used as an exciter signal!

### Twist

This oscillator imports a rather famous Eurorack macro oscillator into Surge XT, based on Émilie Gillet's
device. You can read the manual for the hardware module on which this oscillator is based
[here](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/manual).

This implementation presents all 16 oscillator modes and the controls are dynamically renamed
appropriately for every model. Core differences between the hardware module and Surge XT's implementation are:

1. By default, the LPG in the module is disabled, but by activating the LPG level and decay sliders with (right-click, then Activate),
   the LPG will be triggered per voice for each received MIDI note.

2. By default, you can mix between the main and the auxiliary oscillator outputs with the **Mix** parameter.
   You can also right-click the Mix parameter and enable **Pan main and auxiliary signals** option,
   in which case -100% value is Main to left/Aux to right, +100% is Main to right/Aux to left, and 0% is an even mix of both signals sent to both left and right.
   Do note that for this to be audible, you have to be in one of stereo filter configuration modes.

Twist can be more CPU demanding than most other Surge XT oscillator algorithms.
Judiciously using maximum polyphony setting and being careful with Amp EG release times
can go a long way in minimizing the CPU usage, thus making robust patches.

### Alias

The Alias oscillator purposefully ignores a few decades of research into making digital signals with low or no
aliasing, and does all the things you shouldn't do, so it purposefully sounds digital, gross, broken, terrible,
yet awesome all at once.

#### Shape

**Shape** parameter (comes in the form of a menu) is very important and is worth explaining in more detail,
as it allows you to choose the source used for the Alias algorithm.

In addition to the more regular shapes (such as Sine, Ramp, Pulse and Noise), Surge XT's audio input can be also used.

Going further, there is Additive, which allows you to create a custom waveform by adjusting amplitudes of up to 16
harmonics, accessible by clicking on the Edit button that appears in this mode:

![Illustration 73: Alias additive editor](./images/manual-xt/Pictures/alias_additive_editor.png)

This editor works in a similar way to the step sequencer editor, however there are some additional options available when right-clicking:

-   **Shapes** - Partial level presets which roughly represent different wave shapes, including a random option.
-   **Absolute** - Sets the level of all the partials in the positive range.
-   **Invert** - Flips the partial levels vertically.
-   **Reverse** - Flips the partial levels horizontally.

Additionally, you can also use **Quadrant Shaping** waveforms as a source, which are also found in the
[Sine](#sine) oscillator.

Finally, we have various **Memory from...** options:

-   **This Alias Instance** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with the currently selected instance of Alias.
-   **Oscillator Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with general oscillator data.
-   **Step Sequencer Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with step sequencer data.
-   **Scene Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with general scene data.
-   **DAW Chunk Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory that serves as additional DAW chunk data (various non-automatable parameters and settings).

**Note:** When using **Memory From...** as a source, there is no guarantee that the resulting waveform
will be consistent, as memory data can vary depending on a number of things: the DAW used, the particular Surge XT instance, rebooting your machine, and so on.
Thus, it's good practice to bounce the audio output from Surge XT when using this mode.
You know what they say; "If you like it, you should... put a mic on it."

### S&H Noise

S&H is an abbreviation for 'Sample and Hold'. The S&H Noise oscillator algorithm works like a pulse oscillator,
but instead of always switching between +1 and -1, the levels used are determined stochastically.

The correlation parameter determines how new levels are calculated. A
setting of 0% will have no memory and each new level will
effectively be a random number (white noise). A lower setting will
favor new values that are closer to the previous level and will
provide noise with a darker spectra. Higher values will favor
values as far away from the previous one as possible, with 100%
resulting in a harmonic pulse wave.

### Audio Input

Audio Input lets you route external audio into the voice architecture of
Surge XT. It also allows you to route the audio output from Scene A into Scene B.

Note: When using the Audio Input oscillator type in Scene B to get audio from Scene A,
you will likely want to **set Play Mode to Latch**. That way, Scene B will always be triggered.

## Filters

There are multiple filter algorithms available for each of the 2
filter units in the filter block. Each of the algorithms have
different subtypes, which alter their sound.

Some of the filter-(sub)types have some non-linear elements in them
to allow them to self-oscillate in a stable and predictable manner.
This means they will sound different depending on how hard they're
driven, which can be conveniently controlled with the Pre-Filter
Gain setting found in the mixer. For example, if the resonance peaks of a filter is too
loud, increase the Pre-Filter Gain to make the rest of the signal
more dominant (and if needed decrease the gain at the output stage
of the voice to compensate).

Filters in Surge XT are divided into the following categories:

-   Lowpass filters
-   Highpass filters
-   Bandpass filters
-   Notch filters
-   Effect filters

### Filter Types

**12 dB** - 2-Pole filter. Available in **Lowpass**, **Highpass**, **Bandpass**
and **Notch** types.

**24 dB** - 4-Pole filter. Available in **Lowpass**, **Highpass**, **Bandpass**
and **Notch** types.

Sub-types for both **12 dB** and **24 dB**:

1. **Standard** - clear with a strong resonance, capable of self-oscillation. Handles transient behavior extremely well.
2. **Driven** - chesty, somewhat distorted sound with a more held-back resonance. Capable of self-oscillation.
3. **Clean** - the smoothest and cleanest sounding subtype, capable of lower resonance than the others, which is suitable when you do not want the sound of the filter to be noticed but only to roll-off a part of the spectrum.

**Legacy Ladder** - 4-Pole ladder filter. This is Surge's original and older ladder filter.
It has stable self-oscillation and requires less CPU processing than the newer Vintage Ladder filter.
Available in **Lowpass** type.

Sub-types:

1. **6 dB** - Output taken from 1<sup>st</sup> stage (1-pole).
2. **12 dB** - Output taken from 2<sup>nd</sup> stage (2-pole).
3. **18 dB** - Output taken from 3<sup>rd</sup> stage (3-pole).
4. **24 dB** - Output taken from 4<sup>th</sup> stage (4-pole).

**Vintage Ladder** - 4-Pole ladder filter. This is a more recent, accurate and often better-sounding ladder filter.
It also has stable self-oscillation, but requires more CPU processing than the older Legacy Ladder filter.
Available in **Lowpass** type.

Sub-types:

1. **Type 1** - Imitates a Moog resonant filter by Runge-Kutta numerical integration of
   a differential equation approximately describing the dynamics of the circuit.
2. **Type 1 Compensated** - Gain-compensated version of Type 1.
3. **Type 2** - Moog Ladder filter that builds upon the work done by Smith and Stilson from Antti Huovilainen's paper.
4. **Type 2 Compensated** - Gain compensated version of Type 2.

For more information on the development of the Tri-Pole filter, please see
[this Python notebook](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-python/blob/main/scripts/dsp_simulations/ThreelerAnalysis.ipynb)
which outlines the development of the signal processing building blocks behind the filter.

**Allpass** - As its name suggests, this filter passes all frequencies equally in gain. However, it is useful to alter the phase relationship in the spectrum. Unless feedback is involved, its effect can mostly be heard when the Cutoff frequency is in movement. Thus, modulation can be used to get interesting results.

Allpass can be found under the **Effect** category.

**Comb +** and **Comb -** - Comb filter, which is different compared to the previous filter types since it doesn't
filter any part of the spectrum, but instead plays back the original signal with a delay. The former type has
positive feedback and the latter has negative feedback.

Sub-types:

1. **50% Wet**
2. **100% Wet**

When the sub-type is set to 2 and resonance is 0%, the
comb filter will work purely as a delay unit (with sub-sample
precision). This can be used together with the other filter unit
along with filter block feedback to provide interesting options. The
"Winds/Clarinet" and " Plucks/Simple Waveguide" patches
showcase how this ability can be used for simple physical modeling.
They only use the oscillator section to ignite the sound, the rest
is in the filter block.

Moreover, the negative comb filter produces the sound an octave lower than the positive comb filter.

Comb + and Comb - can be found in the **Effect** category.

**Sample & Hold** - The Sample & Hold module will sample the audio at the rate set by the
cutoff frequency. Resonance will emphasize oscillations around the
cutoff frequency, not unlike the resonance peak of a lowpass filter.

Sample & Hold can be found in the **Effect** category.

## Effects

Surge XT has 8 effect units which each can run one of the 10 provided
algorithms.

### EQ

The EQ unit provides 3-bands of fully parametric equalizing. This
high-quality algorithm has a much better response at high frequencies
than digital equalizers usually have.

### Exciter

Exciter is a harmonic exciter based on the famous Aphex Aural Exciter unit.

### Graphic EQ

Graphic EQ is, as its name suggests, a graphic equalizer. It is comprised of
11 level-adjustable and deactivatable (from the right-click menu) bands, which
makes this equalizer better than the normal EQ at sculpting relatively complex response curves.
Apart from the fact that there is also an output gain control at the bottom
of the interface, there is not much else to add.

### Resonator

The Resonator provides carefully tuned lowpass, bandpass, bandpass + notch or highpass filters,
each with individual output gain and resonance. By default, the filters cannot be driven into self-oscillation,
but if you right-click any of the three **Resonance** parameters and enable **Modulation extends into self-oscillation**,
modulation sources can drive the filters to a self-oscillating point. Similarly, the three resonator bands
are tuned to match the ranges of a very famous resonator circuit, but they can be extended to allow a wider range.

### Tape

Tape effect is a port of the Chow Tape Model tape emulation effect, a real-time
physical model of a reel-to-reel analog tape machine. The model contains
parameters for controlling the amount of tape distortion and degradation,
as well as physical characteristics of the tape machine, like the play head
width, or tape thickness.

The original plugin can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel),
and signal processing details are outlined in [this 2019
DAFx paper](http://dafx2019.bcu.ac.uk/papers/DAFx2019_paper_3.pdf).

### Waveshaper

The full waveshaper module present in the sound shaping section of the synth (see [Waveshaper](#waveshaper))
is also available as an effect unit which, like other effects, can be loaded anywhere in the FX signal path.
It also hosts additional controls for further adjustments of the resulting distorted output.

### Combulator

Combulator effect is somewhat similar to the [Resonator](#resonator) in that it
is also made of three filter bands. However, it uses comb filters instead.
These three filters are tuned to a center pitch and two offsets, each with
its own gain control, and combs 2 and 3 with individual pan.
A common use case is to use a monophonic (scene-level) modulation source like **Highest Key** to modulate the
center pitch. The circuit also implements an envelope
follower on the input signal, and mixes additional noise in based on the followed envelope and the **Extra
Noise** parameter.

### Frequency Shifter

Based on the classic Bode frequency shifter effect, which uses a carrier wave to shift frequencies linearly.
This changes the frequency relationships between overtones, usually resulting in a more inharmonic sound.
This version also provides a delay unit and a feedback loop to create
consecutively shifted repeating delays, as heard in a classic english sci-fi theme.

### Nimbus

The Nimbus effect imports the granular texture effect from Émilie Gillet's Eurorack project.
You can read the manual for the hardware device on which this effect is based
[here](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/manual).

The labels and ranges in the effect adjust based on the mode to allow you to use this
effect appropriately in Surge XT.

### Treemonster

Treemonster is a specialized effect ported from Shortcircuit 2, a proper Vember Audio classic!
Treemonster runs a naïve pitch detection algorithm on the input signal, runs a
sine oscillator at the detected pitch, then ring modulates the input signal with the
resulting tuned sine oscillator. It can get pretty crazy, especially if you apply pitch
shifts to the generated oscillator. Like the emulated analog ring modulation in Surge XT,
this effect can very rapidly become very inharmonic.
