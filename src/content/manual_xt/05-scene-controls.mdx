# Scene controls

Sound is generated then shaped.

![Illustration 13: Scene controls](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/scene_sections.png)

## Sound generation

When you play a note, oscillators generate waveforms and send them to the mixer.

![Illustration 14: Sound generation](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/sound_generation.png)

### Oscillators

To display an oscillator for editing, select **Oscillator** buttons **1**, **2**, or **3**.
If the oscillator is muted in the [mixer](#mixer), the waveform displays dimmed.

To copy an oscillator, right-click **1**, **2**, or **3**, then select **Copy** or **Copy with modulation** from the context menu.

To change [oscillator algorithm](#oscillator-algorithms), select the drop-down list at the bottom-right of the oscillator area:

- Classic
- Modern
- Wavetable
- Window
- Sine (default)
- FM2
- FM3
- String
- Twist
- Alias
- S&H Noise
- Audio Input.

To select a wavetable with **Wavetable** or **Window** oscillators, select the wavetable name or its arrow buttons, or
you can right-click to select within the current wavetable category.

#### Pitch

**Pitch & Octave** control the pitch for the oscillator.

To extend the range of the **Pitch** control, select **Extend Range** from the context menu.

To select a pitch offset in Hz, instead of a semitone (note degree) offset, select **Absolute** from the context menu.

#### Keytrack

To toggle key tracking for the oscillator, select or unselect **Keytrack**.
When unselected, the oscillator plays at a fixed pitch that is the same for all notes.

To toggle key tracking for all oscillators, right-click **Keytrack** then select **Enable Keytrack For All Oscillators** or
**Disable keytrack for all oscillators**.

#### Retrigger

To toggle retriggering for the oscillator, select or unselect **Retrigger**.
When active, each voice starts with the oscillator and all its unison voices at the same phase position.

To toggle retriggering for all oscillators, right-click **Retrigger** then select **Enable Retrigger For All Oscillators** or
**Disable Retrigger For All Oscillators**.

**Hint**:
When you enable **Retrigger**, each note onset sounds more consistent or 'snappy'.
When you disable **Retrigger**, the onset can sound more varied and less 'digital'.

#### Other oscillator controls

Other controls are specific to each [oscillator type](#oscillator-algorithms).

### Mixer

#### Mixer channels

The mixer controls six channels, and a **Pre-filter Gain**:

- **Oscillator 1**
- **Oscillator 2**
- **Oscillator 3**
- **Ring Modulation of 1 &times; 2**
- **Ring Modulation of 2 &times; 3**
- **Noise Oscillator**

Surge XT uses 'digital ring modulation', multiplying the raw output of two oscillators.

To choose a ring modulation mode, right-click a slider, and select **Ring Modulation**,
**Continuous XOR**, or **Scale-Invariant Linear Modulation** types 1 to 9.

You can also [apply ring modulation to the pair of filter outputs](#filter-controls) with **Filter Configuration** > **Ring**.

#### Channel parameters

To change gain for a channel, move its [slider](#sliders-and-controls).

To mute a channel, select **M**. Select again to unmute.

To mute a channel and unmute the other channels, hold Ctrl and select **M**.

To solo a channel, select **S**. Select **S** again to unsolo. If any channel has solo enabled, then the mixer ignores all mutes.

To solo a channel and unsolo the other channels, hold Ctrl and select **S**.

To select which filters a channel routes to, select from the group of three boxes:

- **Left** routes the channel output to filter 1.
- **Center** routes the channel output to filters 1 and 2.
- **Right** routes the channel output to filter 2.

See also: [filter configuration](#filter-configuration).

### <a name="other-sound-generation-parameters"></a>Scene pitch and octave

To offset the pitch of the scene, move the **Pitch** slider.
To offset the pitch of the scene by whole octaves, select a **Scene** **Octave** from -3 to +3.

**Note**: Scene pitch parameters add to keytrack values used by **Filter 1 Keytrack**, **Filter 2 Keytrack**, and to the **Keytrack** modulation source.

### Portamento

To change the time for pitch to change from one note to the next, move the **Portamento** slider.

From the **Portamento** context menu:

- To sync portamento time with the tempo, select **Tempo Sync**.
- To make portamento change pitch at a constant rate, enable **Constant rate**. Portamento is then the time to move over one octave. When **Constant rate** is disabled, portamento time is the same for all notes.
- To quantize portamento to pitch degrees (semitones), enable **Glissando**.
- To retrigger [envelope generators](#envelope-generators) (FEG and AEG) as pitch crosses scale degrees, enable **Retrigger at scale degrees**.
- To change the portamento curve, select **Curve options**, then **Logarithmic**, **Linear** (default) or **Exponential**.

### <a name="osc-drift"></a>Oscillator drift

To independently vary the pitch of all oscillators and their unison voices, enable **Osc Drift**.

To also randomize the pitch at the very start of the note, right-click and enable **Randomize initial drift phase**.

### Noise color

To shape the timbre of the noise generator, move the **Noise Color** slider:

- Low frequencies to the left
- White noise in the middle
- High frequencies to the right.

### Bend depth

To control the pitch wheel range, from 0 to 24 semitones:
- left-click **Bend Depth** > **Down** or **Bend Depth > Up**, and then drag up or down.
- hover over **Bend Depth** > **Down** or **Bend Depth > Up**, and use the scroll wheel.
- right-click **Bend Depth** > **Down** or **Bend Depth > Up**, select **Edit value** from the context menu, and enter a value. You can also enter decimal numbers, fractions, and cents.

### Play mode

To select a play mode, select from the **Play Mode** group, or right-click and select from the context menu.

- **Poly** mode lets you to play many notes at the same time, up to the [polyphony limit](polyphony-limit).
- **Mono** modes only play one note, which depends on [note priority](note-priority). By default, the latest note has priority.
- **Latch** mode plays the latest note continuously without releasing.

#### Poly play mode

With **Play Mode** set to **Poly**:

- To use a new voice for a replayed note, select **Stack Multiple**. This is also known as 'round robin', and is the default.
- To reuse a voice that is already playing the same note as your new note, select **Reuse Single**.

#### Mono play modes

- **Mono** mode plays only the latest note.
- **Mono (ST)** or **Mono (Single Trigger)** mode does not retrigger the envelope generators when sliding between two overlapping notes.
- **Mono (FP)** or **Mono (Fingered Portamento)** mode applies portamento only between overlapping notes.
- **Mono (ST+FP)** or **Mono (Single Trigger & Fingered Portamento)** combines **Mono (ST)** and **Mono (FP)** modes.

To set <a name="note-priority"></a>note priority, right-click the **Play Mode** area and select one of: 

- **Last** to play the latest note only. When released, play the latest remaining note. This is the default option.
- **High** to play the highest note only. When released, play the highest remaining note.
- **Low** to play the lowest note only. When released, play the lowest remaining note.
- **Legacy** to play the latest note. When released, play the highest remaining note.

To set <a name="envelope-retrigger-behavior"></a>envelope retrigger behavior, right-click the **Play Mode** area and select one of: 

- **Reset To Zero** to reset evenelopes to the beginning of the attack stage when you start a note. This is the default option.
- **Continue From Current Level** to make envelopes continue from the level of the previous note.

To set <a name="sustain-pedal-mono"></a>behavior when the sustain pedal is pressed in mono mode, right-click the **Play Mode** area, select **Sustain pedal in mono mode**, then select one of: 

- **Sustain pedal holds all notes (no note off retrigger)** to stay on the priority note when you release that note. This is the default option.
- **Sustain pedal allows note off retrigger** to switch to the remaining priority note when you release the priority note.

## Sound shaping

![Illustration 15: Sound shaping](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/sound_shaping.png)

### Filter controls

To select how the filters, waveshaper, and gain stage connect together, select a **Filter Configuration**:

- **Serial 1** routes the signal from the Mixer goes into Filter 1, then into the Waveshaper, then into Filter 2, then the
  Amplifier which contains the Amplifier Envelope Generator (AEG), before going through the Scene Highpass and to the final
  Scene Output section.
- **Serial 2** is the same as with **Serial 1**, plus a feedback path from the
  output of the Amplifier back into Filter 1.
- **Serial 3** is the same as with **Serial 2**, but Filter 2 is in the feedback loop, which is after
  the signal tap from the Amplifier instead of before.
- **Dual 1** routes the signal from the Mixer to both Filter 1 and Filter 2 in parallel. The outputs from both filters are
  summed, then sent to the Waveshaper, then into the Amplifier, and finally in the Scene Highpass before the Scene Output section. Feedback is again tapped at the output of the Amplifier and goes back into both filters (it's summed with the output from the Mixer).
- **Dual 2** is the same as with **Dual 1**, except the Waveshaper is only applied to Filter 1
  before its output is summed with the output from Filter 2.
- **Stereo** is the same as with **Dual 1**, except Filter 1 is always on the left channel and
  Filter 2 is always on the right channel.
- **Ring** is the same as with **Dual 1**, except the outputs from Filter 1 and Filter 2 are multiplied
  (ring modulated) together instead of being summed before the Waveshaper.
- **Wide** is the same as with **Serial 2**, except it's doubled for a full stereo signal path.

**Notes**:
- Only **Stereo** and **Wide** output a stereo signal.
- If you set **Filter Configuration** to **S1**, **S2**, **S3**, or **Wide**, then any output from filter 1 then routes to filter 2, so **Left** or **Center** routes pass through both filters in turn.
- If you set **Filter Configuration** to **Ring**, then to hear sound, you need to route some sound to each filter.
- If you set **Filter Configuration** to **Wide**, then *Left* and *Right* routes are hard-panned to stereo positions.

#### Feedback

To set the amount (and polarity) of output fed back into the input of the filter block, move the **Feedback** slider. It has no effect for **Serial 1**, because that configurations has no feedback path.

**Warning**: Be careful with your monitoring volume when using feedback. It's easy to
make really loud high-pitched noises by mistake if you're not familiar
with how Surge XT processes feedback.

**Hint**: Feedback is a creative technique that helps you change the character of filters, make
filters interact together, create basic physical models, or make unstable sounds.

**Filter Balance** – Controls how the two filters are mixed. The
behavior depends on the filter block configuration.

**Type** – Selects the type of the filter. There are [numerous types available](#filters).
You can disable the filter in question here by unchecking the **Enabled** option below the different
filter type categories.

**Subtype** – Selects variations of each filter type. The difference can
vary from subtle to radical depending on how the filter is used. See
[Filters](#filters) in the Technical Reference section
for information regarding subtypes of each filter type. It is displayed
as a number next to the filter type (when available).

**Cutoff** – Controls the cutoff frequency of the filter. When tweaked, while its tooltip
will show frequency in Hz, it will also show its approximate MIDI note value,
very useful when using the filter for melodic and tuning purposes.
You can also right-click on this control and choose the option
**Reset cutoff to keytrack root** which makes it very easy to tune filters
when using filter keytracking. Finally, the **Apply SCL/KBM tuning to filter cutoff**
option can be accessed when the **Apply tuning after modulation** option is enabled in the Tuning menu.
See the [microtuning](#microtuning) section for more information.

**Resonance** – Controls the amount of resonance of the filter.

**Filter Analysis** – To open the Filter Analysis window, simply click on the small button above the filter
balance control. It will display the current filter response according to the current type, subtype, cutoff and
resonance settings. You can switch to the other filter by using the corresponding buttons. You can also drag on the
display horizontally to change the displayed filter's cutoff frequency, and drag vertically to change its resonance.

![Illustration 16: Filter Analysis](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/filter_analysis.png)

**Filter 2 Offset Button** (small "+" button to the right of the filter parameters) – When active,
the cutoff frequency will be set relative to filter 1.
This includes any modulations (including the hardwired FEG depth &
keytracking). Filter 2's cutoff frequency slider **becomes an offset** setting relative
to filter 1's cutoff frequency.

**Resonance Link Button** (small button, filter 2 only) – Makes the slider
follow filter 1's resonance slider setting.

**Keytrack \> F1/F2** – Controls how much the pitch of a note affects the
cutoff frequency of the filter. A setting of 100% means the filter
frequency will follow the pitch harmonically.

### Envelope generators

There are two envelope generators connected to the filter block.

![Illustration 17: Envelope generators](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/EGs.png)

On the left is the Filter Envelope Generator (Filter EG).
It is hardwired to the two filters, whose depth is set by the **\>F1** and **\>F2** sliders.

On the right is the Amplifier Envelope Generator (Amp EG). This one is hardwired to the gain
stage of the filter block.

![Illustration 18: ADSR envelope structure](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/illu10.png)

_The ADSR envelope structure_

The envelope generators are of the 4-stage ADSR type. This is the most
common form of EG used in synthesizers and it is named after its four
stages **Attack**, **Decay**, **Sustain** and **Release**. If you're new
to synthesizer programming the illustration should give you a good idea
how they work. The thing you need to remember is that after going
through the attack & decay stages the envelope will stick in the sustain
stage until the key is released.

**Attack**, **Decay** and **Release** are time-based parameters and can be tempo-synced by right-clicking on one of
those sliders. You will also find an option to tempo-sync those three controls at once for each envelope generator.

Above the envelope stage controls is a graphic representation of the
ADSR structure.

If the envelope mode is set to **Digital**, there will be small adjustable orange fields
on the graphic. Dragging them horizontally allows you to choose the curvature of the different stages of the envelope.

![Illustration 19: ASDR envelope fields](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/EGs_orange_fields.png)

If the envelope mode is set to **Analog**, the curvature of the different stages
will automatically be set to a shape that tries to emulate analog behavior.

### Waveshaper

The waveshaper module now features 43 waveforms and is an integral part of Surge's audio path.

![Illustration 20: Waveshaper](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/waveshaper.png)

**Waveshaper selector** - Menu allowing you to change the type of the non-linear wave-shaping.
Alternatively, you can also use the arrow buttons, left-click and drag, or scroll with the mouse wheel
over the waveshaper display to cycle through the different shapes.

**Waveshaper drive** – The vertical slider to the right of the waveshaper display. Sets the drive amount
of the waveshaper. This control can be extended.

**Waveshaper Analysis window** - This panel can be opened by clicking on the small icon at the
bottom of the waveshaper module. It allows you to visually preview the output of the waveshaper
at different input levels, which can be controlled with the waveshaper's **Drive** control.

![Illustration 21: Waveshaper analysis](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/waveshaper_analysis.png)

### Other sound shaping parameters

**Keytrack root note** – Sets the root key of the filter keytracking and the
keytrack modulation source. At the root key, the keytrack modulation
source will have the value zero. Above/below it it will have
positive/negative modulation depending on the distance to the root key
in octaves. This parameter does not affect the oscillator pitch.

**Keytrack amount sliders** - Sets the amount of filter keytracking applied to
each filter.

**HP** – Controls the scene high-pass filter (scene parameter). This parameter can be disabled, which will remove it
from the audio path. You also have a choice for filter slope between **12**, **24**, **36**, **48** dB/Octave.

**FM configuration** – Chooses how oscillator FM (frequency modulation) is
routed.

**FM depth** – Sets the depth of the oscillator FM.

**Amp Vel.** - Controls how the **Amp Gain** scales with velocity. This
is neutral at the maximum position. Other settings provide attenuation
at lower velocities, thus this setting will never increase the **Amp
Gain** parameter by velocity.

**Amp Gain** – Controls the gain element inside the filter block.

### Scene Output

The output stage is located after the filter block in the audio-path. As
it's outside the filter block-structure changing the gain here doesn't
have any affect on the timbre of the voice (unlike the previous
gain-control which may affect how the feedback and wave-shaping acts),
but it can still change the timbre of the effect section if non-linear
effects (like distortion) are used.

**Volume** – Scene volume control. You can choose to hard clip the scene output at **+18 dBFS** (default),
**0 dBFS** , or to **disable hard clipping** by right-clicking this control and choosing the desired option.
Additionally, it is also possible to mute the scene currently being edited by choosing the option **Mute scene A/B**.
This is useful when sending the audio of scene A into scene B using the [Audio Input](#audio-input)
oscillator algorithm, for instance. In this example, the effects of Scene A will effectively be bypassed.

**Pan** – Pan/balance control

**Width** – The amount of stereo spread (only present for the **Stereo** and
**Wide** filter block configurations)

**Send FX 1/2 or 3/4 Level** – Send levels to send slot 1 to 4 (scene parameters).
To display the send 3/4 levels, simply select one of those send FX units in the unit selector
(see [Effect Unit Selector](#effect-unit-selector)).
