# Scene Controls

Sound is generated then shaped.

![Illustration 13: Scene controls](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/scene_sections.png)

## Sound Generation

When you play a note, oscillators generate waveforms and send them to the mixer.

![Illustration 14: Sound generation](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/sound_generation.png)

### Oscillators

To display an oscillator for editing, select **Oscillator** buttons **1**, **2**, or **3**.
If the oscillator is muted in the [mixer](#mixer), the waveform displays dimmed.

To copy an oscillator, right-click **1**, **2**, or **3**, then select **Copy** or **Copy with modulation** from the context menu.

To change [oscillator algorithm](#oscillator-algorithms), select the drop-down list at the bottom-right of the oscillator area:

- Classic
- Modern
- Wavetable
- Window
- Sine (default)
- FM2
- FM3
- String
- Twist
- Alias
- S&H Noise
- Audio Input.

To select a wavetable with **Wavetable** or **Window** oscillators, select the wavetable name or its arrow buttons, or
you can right-click to select within the current wavetable category.

#### Pitch

**Pitch & Octave** control the pitch for the oscillator.

To extend the range of the **Pitch** control, select **Extend Range** from the context menu.

To select a pitch offset in Hz, instead of a semitone (note degree) offset, select **Absolute** from the context menu.

#### Keytrack

To toggle key tracking for the oscillator, select or unselect **Keytrack**.
When unselected, the oscillator plays at a fixed pitch that is the same for all notes.

To toggle key tracking for all oscillators, right-click **Keytrack** then select **Enable Keytrack For All Oscillators** or
**Disable keytrack for all oscillators**.

#### Retrigger

To toggle retriggering for the oscillator, select or unselect **Retrigger**.
When active, each voice starts with the oscillator and all its unison voices at the same phase position.

To toggle retriggering for all oscillators, right-click **Retrigger** then select **Enable Retrigger For All Oscillators** or
**Disable Retrigger For All Oscillators**.

**Hint**:
When you enable **Retrigger**, each note onset sounds more consistent or 'snappy'.
When you disable **Retrigger**, the onset can sound more varied and less 'digital'.

#### Other Oscillator Controls

Other controls are specific to each [oscillator type](#oscillator-algorithms).

### Mixer

#### Mixer Channels

The mixer controls six channels, and a **Pre-filter Gain**:

- **Oscillator 1**
- **Oscillator 2**
- **Oscillator 3**
- **Ring Modulation of 1 &times; 2**
- **Ring Modulation of 2 &times; 3**
- **Noise Oscillator**

Surge XT uses 'digital ring modulation', multiplying the raw output of two oscillators.

To choose a ring modulation mode, right-click a slider, and select **Ring Modulation**,
**Continuous XOR**, or **Scale-Invariant Linear Modulation** types 1 to 9.

You can also [apply ring modulation to the pair of filter outputs](#filter-controls) with **Filter Configuration** > **Ring**.

#### Channel Parameters

To change gain for a channel, move its [slider](#sliders-and-controls).

To mute a channel, select **M**. Select again to unmute.

To mute a channel and unmute the other channels, hold Ctrl and select **M**.

To solo a channel, select **S**. Select **S** again to unsolo. If any channel has solo enabled, then the mixer ignores all mutes.

To solo a channel and unsolo the other channels, hold Ctrl and select **S**.

To select which filters a channel routes to, select from the group of three boxes:

- **Left** routes the channel output to filter 1.
- **Center** routes the channel output to filters 1 and 2.
- **Right** routes the channel output to filter 2.

See also: [filter configuration](#filter-configuration).

### <a name="other-sound-generation-parameters"></a>Scene Pitch and Octave

To offset the pitch of the scene, move the **Pitch** slider.
To offset the pitch of the scene by whole octaves, select a **Scene** **Octave** from -3 to +3.

**Note**: Scene pitch parameters add to keytrack values used by **Filter 1 Keytrack**, **Filter 2 Keytrack**, and to the **Keytrack** modulation source.

### Portamento

To change the time for pitch to change from one note to the next, move the **Portamento** slider.

From the **Portamento** context menu:

- To sync portamento time with the tempo, select **Tempo Sync**.
- To make portamento change pitch at a constant rate, enable **Constant rate**. Portamento is then the time to move over one octave. When **Constant rate** is disabled, portamento time is the same for all notes.
- To quantize portamento to pitch degrees (semitones), enable **Glissando**.
- To retrigger [envelope generators](#envelope-generators) (FEG and AEG) as pitch crosses scale degrees, enable **Retrigger at scale degrees**.
- To change the portamento curve, select **Curve options**, then **Logarithmic**, **Linear** (default) or **Exponential**.

### <a name="osc-drift"></a>Oscillator Drift

To independently vary the pitch of all oscillators and their unison voices, enable **Osc Drift**.

To also randomize the pitch at the very start of the note, right-click and enable **Randomize initial drift phase**.

### Noise color

To shape the timbre of the noise generator, move the **Noise Color** slider:

- Low frequencies to the left
- White noise in the middle
- High frequencies to the right.

### Bend Depth

To control the pitch wheel range, from 0 to 24 semitones:
- left-click **Bend Depth** > **Down** or **Bend Depth > Up**, and then drag up or down.
- hover over **Bend Depth** > **Down** or **Bend Depth > Up**, and use the scroll wheel.
- right-click **Bend Depth** > **Down** or **Bend Depth > Up**, select **Edit value** from the context menu, and enter a value. You can also enter decimal numbers, fractions, and cents.

### Play Mode

To select a play mode, select from the **Play Mode** list, or right-click and select from the context menu.

- **Poly** mode lets you to play many notes at the same time, up to the [polyphony limit](polyphony-limit).
- **Mono** modes only play one note, which depends on [note priority](note-priority). By default, the latest note has priority.
- **Latch** mode is like **Mono FP**, but immediately starts playing note C5, and holds the latest note continuously without releasing.

#### Poly Play Mode

With **Play Mode** set to **Poly**:

- To use a new voice for a replayed note, select **Stack Multiple**. This is also known as 'round robin', and is the default.
- To reuse a voice that is already playing the same note as your new note, select **Reuse Single**.

#### Mono Play Modes

- **Mono** mode plays only the latest note.
- **Mono (ST)** or **Mono (Single Trigger)** mode does not retrigger the envelope generators when sliding between two overlapping notes.
- **Mono (FP)** or **Mono (Fingered Portamento)** mode applies portamento only between overlapping notes.
- **Mono (ST+FP)** or **Mono (Single Trigger & Fingered Portamento)** combines **Mono (ST)** and **Mono (FP)** modes.

To set <a name="note-priority"></a>note priority, right-click the **Play Mode** area and select one of: 

- **Last** to play the latest note only. When released, play the latest remaining note. This is the default option.
- **High** to play the highest note only. When released, play the highest remaining note.
- **Low** to play the lowest note only. When released, play the lowest remaining note.
- **Legacy** to play the latest note. When released, play the highest remaining note.

To set <a name="envelope-retrigger-behavior"></a>envelope retrigger behavior, right-click the **Play Mode** area and select one of: 

- **Reset To Zero** to reset evenelopes to the beginning of the attack stage when you start a note. This is the default option.
- **Continue From Current Level** to make envelopes continue from the level of the previous note.

To set <a name="sustain-pedal-mono"></a>behavior when the sustain pedal is pressed in mono mode, right-click the **Play Mode** area, select **Sustain pedal in mono mode**, then select one of: 

- **Sustain pedal holds all notes (no note off retrigger)** to stay on the priority note when you release that note. This is the default option.
- **Sustain pedal allows note off retrigger** to switch to the remaining priority note when you release the priority note.

## Sound Shaping

![Illustration 15: Sound shaping](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/sound_shaping.png)

### <a name="filter-configuration"></a>Filter Controls

To select how the filters, waveshaper, and gain stage connect together, select a **Filter Configuration**:

- **Serial 1** routes the signal from the Mixer goes into Filter 1, then into the Waveshaper, then into Filter 2, then the Amplifier which contains the Amplifier Envelope Generator (AEG), before going through the Scene Highpass and to the final Scene Output section.
- **Serial 2** is the same as with **Serial 1**, plus a feedback path from the output of the Amplifier back into Filter 1.
- **Serial 3** is the same as with **Serial 2**, but Filter 2 is in the feedback loop, which is after the signal tap from the Amplifier instead of before.
- **Dual 1** routes the signal from the Mixer to both Filter 1 and Filter 2 in parallel. The outputs from both filters are summed, then sent to the Waveshaper, then into the Amplifier, and finally in the Scene Highpass before the Scene Output section. Feedback is again tapped at the output of the Amplifier and goes back into both filters (it's summed with the output from the Mixer).
- **Dual 2** is the same as with **Dual 1**, except the Waveshaper is only applied to Filter 1 before its output is summed with the output from Filter 2.
- **Stereo** is the same as with **Dual 1**, except Filter 1 is always on the left channel and Filter 2 is always on the right channel.
- **Ring** is the same as with **Dual 1**, except the outputs from Filter 1 and Filter 2 are multiplied (ring modulated) together instead of being summed before the Waveshaper.
- **Wide** is the same as with **Serial 2**, except it's doubled for a full stereo signal path.

**Notes**:
- Only **Stereo** and **Wide** output a stereo signal.
- If you set **Filter Configuration** to **S1**, **S2**, **S3**, or **Wide**, then any output from filter 1 then routes to filter 2, so **Left** or **Center** routes pass through both filters in turn.
- If you set **Filter Configuration** to **Ring**, then to hear sound, you need to route some sound to each filter.
- If you set **Filter Configuration** to **Wide**, then *Left* and *Right* routes are hard-panned to stereo positions.

#### Feedback

To set the amount (and polarity) of output fed back into the input of the filter block, move the **Feedback** slider. It has no effect for **Serial 1**, because that configurations has no feedback path.

**Warning**: Take special care with feedback, effects, and resonance features. Loud sounds increase the risk of damaging equipment or hearing. You should use the limiter on [Global Volume](#global-volume), and in your DAW or downstream equipment.

**Hint**: Feedback is a creative technique that helps you change the character of filters, make
filters interact together, create basic physical models, or make unstable sounds.

#### Filter Balance

To control how the two filters mix in the filter block configuration, move the **Filter Balance** slider.

#### Filter Type and Filter Subtype

To select the filter type for Filter 1 or Filter 2, select the dropdown list, then select a [Filter Type](#filters). You can also hover over the list and use the scroll wheel, or right-click and select a **Filter Type** in the context menu.

To select a filter subtype by name, right-click the subtype number and select a **Filter Subtype** from the context menu. See [Filters](#filters). To cycle through filter subtypes, select the **Subtype** number next to the dropdown list, or hover over the subtype number and use the scroll wheel.

To enable or disable the filter without changing the filter type, right-click on the dropdown list and toggle **Enabled**.

#### Filter Cutoff

To select the cutoff frequency of a filter, move its *Cutoff** slider. As you move the slider or hover over it, a tooltip displays the frequency value in Hz and its approximate MIDI note name.

To set the **Cutoff** frequency to the *Keytrack Root** frequency, right-click the slider and select **Reset cutoff to keytrack root**. **Hint**: this helps you to tune filters with **Filter Keytrack**.

Finally, the **Apply SCL/KBM tuning to filter cutoff**
option can be accessed when the **Apply tuning after modulation** option is enabled in the Tuning menu.
See the [microtuning](#microtuning) section for more information.

**Hint**: MIDI note names help when you use the filter for melodic and tuning purposes. To snap to the frequency of the nearest note, hold Ctrl while you drag the slider.

#### Filter Resonance

To control the resonance of a filter, move its **Resonance** slider.

#### Filter Analysis

To open the **Filter Analysis** window, select on the small button above the filter
balance control.

To view a filter, select **Filter 1** or **Filter 2** buttons.

To change the **Cutoff** and **Resonance**, drag the display horizontally to change **Cutoff**, and drag vertically to change **Resonance**.

![Illustration 16: Filter Analysis](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/filter_analysis.png)

#### Filter 2 Offset Mode

To link Filter 2 **Cutoff** frequency to that of Filter 1, select the **Filter 2 Offset Mode** button (a small **+** button to the right of the filter parameters)

When filter 2 offset mode is active, the **Cutoff** frequency slider of Filter 2 is an offset relative to the **Cutoff** frequency of Filter 1. When you change the **Cutoff** frequency of Filter 1, Filter 2 follows. This includes any modulations, FEG depth, and Keytrack.

To link the Filter 2 **Resonance** to that of Filter 1, select the **Link Resonance** button (a small chain link button).

When link resonance is active, the **Resonance** slider of Filter 2 is an offset relative to the **Resonance** of Filter 1. When you change the **Resonance** of Filter 1, Filter 2 follows.

#### Filter Keytrack

To control how much the pitch of a note affects the cutoff frequency of a filter, move the **Keytrack** \> **F1/F2** sliders. At 100% keytrack, the filter frequency follows the pitch harmonically.

### Envelope Generators

Envelopes shape your sound over time.

![Illustration 17: Envelope generators](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/EGs.png)

To modulate **Filter 1** or **Filter 2** with the filter envelope, move **FEG Mod Amount** sliders **\>F1** and **\>F2**.

To scale the amplitude envelope, move the **VCA Gain** (**Amp** /> **Gain**) slider.

Filter and amplitude envelopes in Surge XT use ADSR stages: **Attack**, **Decay**, **Sustain**, and **Release**.

![Illustration 18: ADSR envelope structure](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/illu10.png)

After passing through attack and decay stages, the envelope stays in the sustain
stage until you release the note.

To tempo sync any envelope stage, right-click then select **Tempo Sync**, or **Tempo Sync For All ... EG Parameters**.

Release parameters have an additional option in the context menu, **Freeze Release at Sustain Level**, which retains the output level at which the envelope was upon releasing the key for the whole duration of the release stage. This allows better shaping of the release stage with LFO, MSEG or Formula modulators, since the resultant amplitude will not be affected by the decaying nature of the release stage.

To change how the envelope curves to the next stage, select **Analog** or **Digital** from the **... Envelope EG Mode** list.
- **Analog** emulates the curves of analog envelope generators.
- To change the curves of **Digital** envelopes, select or drag to move the highlight on the envelope graph, or right-click and select an option from the context menu. Depending on the stage, options **Convex**, **Linear**, **Quadratic**, and **Concave** are avaialble.

![Illustration 19: ASDR envelope fields](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/EGs_orange_fields.png)

### Waveshaper

A waveshaper transforms each sample through a shaping function ('x to y' graph). For example, a **Saturator** pushes sample values away from 0 and towards the outer limits of the wave.

![Illustration 20: Waveshaper](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/waveshaper.png)

**Note**: The waveshaper applies at different places in different [filter configurations](#filter-configuration). For example, in **Filter Configuration** S2 it applies between Filter 1 and Filter 2, but in **Filter Configuration** D1, it applies after both filters.

To select a shaping function, right-click the graph or select the label, then select a **Waveshaper Type** from the context menu. You can also select the arrow buttons, or hover and use the scroll wheel.

To apply gain before the waveshaper, move the **Waveshaper Drive** slider.

To view the effect that the waveshaper has on a sine wave, select the small **Waveshaper Analysis** graph icon.

![Illustration 21: Waveshaper analysis](/images/manual-xt/Pictures/waveshaper_analysis.png)

### Other Sound Shaping Parameters


#### Keytrack

To change the root key used as the center for keytracking, drag the **Keytrack Root Key** control up or down, hover and use the scroll wheel, or right-click and select **Edit Value**.

At the root key, the keytrack modulation source has a value of zero. Higher notes have positive values, and lower notes have negative values. When you modulate another parameter with Keytrack, the modulation amount you set represents the modulation applied for a note one octave above the **Keytrack Root Key**. **Keytrack Root Key** does not change oscillator pitch.

To control how much the pitch of a note affects the cutoff frequency of a filter, move the **Keytrack** \> **F1/F2** sliders. At 100% keytrack, the filter frequency follows the pitch harmonically.

#### Scene Highpass Filter

To change the cutoff frequency of the scene high-pass filter, move the **HP** (**Highpass**) slider.

To disable **Highpass**, right-click the slider and unselect **Enabled** from the context menu.

To change the filter slope of the high-pass filter, right-click the slider and select a **Slope**:

- **12 dB/Oct**
- **24 dB/Oct**
- **36 dB/Oct**
- **48 dB/Oct**

#### Oscillator FM Routing

To select how FM (frequency modulation) routes through oscillators, select one of:

- **No FM**
- **2 \> 1**
- **3 \>2 \> 1**
- **2 \> 1 \< 3**

To set the depth of oscillator FM, move the **FM depth** slider.

#### Velocity Sensitivity

Surge XT has a simple way to make your patch 'velocity sensitive'.

To select a **VCA Gain** (**Amp** \> **Gain**) for the lowest possible key velocity, move the **Amp Vel.** slider. **Amp Vel.** has no effect at the maximum position of 0 dB. If you play a key at maximum velocity, **Amp Vel.** has no effect.

**VCA Gain** (**Amp** \> **Gain**) controls the gain element inside the filter block.

### Scene Output

To set the gain of the selected scene, move the **Volume** slider. The output stage is after the filter block, so scene volume has no effect on the timbre of the voice before the effects stage.

To select clipping for the selected scene, right-click the **Volume** slider, and in the context menu, select one of:
- **Scene ... Hard Clip Disabled**
- **Scene ... 0 dBFS**
- **Scene ... +18 dBFS** (default)

To mute the current scene, right-click the **Volume** slider, and select **Mute scene A/B** in the context menu. **Hint**: If you feed audio of scene A into scene B with the [Audio Input](#audio-input) oscillator, you'll likely want to mute scene A. This also mutes the signal to Scene A insert effects.

To set stereo panning for the scene, move the **Pan** slider. Around -80% is hard left, and around +80% is hard right.
To set stereo spread for the scene, move the **Width** slider. **Width** is active only for [filter configurations](#filter-configuration) **Stereo** and **Wide**.

To send the scene output to **Send FX slots 1..4**, move the **Send FX ... Level** sliders. To display sends 3 and 4, select one of those FX units in the [Effect Unit Selector](#effect-unit-selector).
