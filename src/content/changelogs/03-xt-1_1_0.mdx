title: Changes in Surge XT 1.1.0
order: 3
id: 1.1.0
---

We released Surge XT 1.1.0 on August 3, 2022. It adds several big new features, including edit history (undo/redo), support for the new CLAP standard, expanded and improved support for accessible interfaces like screen readers, several new DSP and voice management features, and much more.

## Action History

-   Surge XT now supports undo and redo for all actions (even loading patches!) - use either the common Ctrl+Z/Y keyboard shortcuts, or buttons on the GUI
-   If a patch has been modified, it will be marked as dirty and an asterisk will be appended to the patch name
    -   By default, attempting to load a different patch will prompt the user to confirm the loading action in order not to lose your patch modifications
    -   This can be disabled in Menu > Workflow

## CLAP Support

-   CLAP is a new standard for host-plugin interoperability developed by a group of open source and commercial developers. Surge XT is an early adopter and a test case for CLAP. You can read more about CLAP at https://cleveraudio.org/
-   Surge XT implements - exclusively in the CLAP version - the non-destructive modulation (both monophonic and polyphonic!) and note expressions!

## Patch Navigation

-   Patches without categories are displayed in their own category in the Patch Browser
-   Favorites are now also displayed in the Patch Browser, in User Patches section
-   Much improved Find Patch feature!
    -   Search results will now stay open by default after loading a patch, so you can quickly navigate through this list
    -   Ctrl+click or Ctrl+Enter will load the patch and close the search results
    -   There is now an option in Menu > Workflow to bring back the old Surge XT 1.0 behavior, if you so wish
    -   Magnifier button now acts properly as an on/off toggle button
    -   Your last search term is remembered after leaving the Find Patch mode
    -   Search results will now open immediately when entering the Find Patch mode, instead of only when you start typing

## Accessibility

-   Our screen reader community gave us amazing feedback on Surge XT 1.0.1, leading to several changes, improvements and bugfixes
-   Using the announcement API, we read several actions, including patch and favorites changes
-   Fixed several components (oscillator copy/paste, scene copy/paste) which used mouse position improperly to find the source and target
-   Overlay buttons (Tuning, Mod List, MSEG Editor, Formula Editor, etc.) respond properly to Enter, Shift+F10, and so on
-   Step sequencer rotate buttons are now exposed, and order of step and trigger parameters improved
-   Mod List parameter names and accesibility works well
-   Discrete parameters represented as menu buttons in the UI are now using the combo box element instead of a slider in screen readers
-   Effect tab order is now in display order, not internal storage order
-   Every text entry field has a correct focus-restoration target when dismissed
-   The patch search typeahead supports accesible navigation (fully on macOS and with narration workaround on Windows)
-   New Workflow menu options allow you to expand modulation menus to have specific edit/clear/mute submenus, rather than compound multi-click menus
-   Introduced a mode where accesible key presses follow the mouse focus, rather than keyboard focus
-   Many other small changes and fixes

## New Overlays

-   Keyboard shortcut editor:
    -   Allows freely changing or disabling any of the available keyboard shortcut actions offered by Surge XT, in case there is a clash with keyboard shortcuts reserved by your DAW
-   Filter Analysis:
    -   This new overlay will show frequency response curves for Filter 1 and Filter 2, in realtime as you change filter cutoff, resonance and mixer pre-filter gain parameters

## DSP Changes

-   String oscillator improvements:
    -   Various Stiffness filter models which provide better tuning at high stiffness values. "Keytracked and pitch compensated" model is the new default
    -   2x oversampling option, which improves timbral quality for high pitched notes
    -   Choose between three interpolation modes, which can limit energy loss in exchange for accuracy at high frequencies
    -   Remember, right-click everything in Surge! These options are in context menus of Exciter Level and Stiffness parameters
-   Fixed an issue with Twist oscillator's LPG onset, creating occasional glitches in certain oscillator modes
-   Initial audio buffer is no longer filled with denormal noise - instead we rely on flush-to-zero (FTZ) flag in our processors
-   Sample rate is now a property of individual Surge XT instances, rather than global for all Surge XT instances - allows correct behavior when only certain instances are oversampled in hosts that provide this facility (for example, Reaper)
-   Fixed a crash when Reverb 2 was used at a very high sample rate
-   Implemented a small fade out when executing All-Sounds-Off
-   Reset filters on scene release and All-Sounds-Off - by doing so, we have removed a click on transport start in Logic Pro
-   Absolute unison mode now works for Alias and Modern oscillators
-   Scene highpass filter now has slopes up to 48 dB/oct (right-click option)
-   Output meter falloff is now sample rate independent (previously the meter would have a faster falloff on higher sample rates)
-   Fixed a bug where simultaneous chords played on the exact same tick created voices well over the polyphony limit

## Play Mode Updates

-   Both Poly and Mono modes get expanded envelope and voice triggering modes, accesed from the right mouse click context menu on the Play Mode parameter
-   In Poly mode you can choose whether repeated strikes of the same key create a new voice or retrigger the currently playing voice (if there is one)
-   In Mono modes, you can select whether the envelopes (AEG and FEG) retrigger from zero, or from their current level if a voice is playing

## Effects

-   Added multiple clipping options for the feedback path in the Delay effect (right-click the Feedback parameter)
-   Added option to extend the Delay Feedback parameter range, allowing negative feedback
-   Implemented the Tone filter to the Phaser effect (same as the one from Combulator)
-   Added new AirWindows effects: Cabs, Chrome Oxide, Dub Sub, Dub Center, Fire Amp, Glitch Shifter, Nonlinear Space, Pafnuty, Power Sag, Tape Dust, To Vinyl
-   Fixed a bug which could make Nimbus occasionally distort, especially in Looped Delay mode (applies to the Surge XT Effects plugin as well)
-   Spring Reverb's Decay parameter and Flanger's Count parameter now have a more accurate display and value typein behavior
-   Dragging an Airwindows effect around the FX routing grid no longer resets its parameters
-   Delay's Feedback parameter can now be extended, allowing negative feedback

## Modulation

-   All LFOs now have 3 outputs: the signal multiplied by the LFO EG, the raw LFO signal alone, and the LFO EG alone
-   LFO attack will now start after setting up voice level modulators - this enables modulating voice LFO amplitude with velocity, which didn't work before
-   The range of the fractional part of the LFO phase is supposed to be strictly `[0, 1)`, excluding the maximum, whereas before it could hit exactly 1, which is not supposed to happen
-   Fixed S&H and Noise LFO types not properly freerunning for Scene LFOs
-   Removed a check which improperly changed song position with DAW looping enabled and transport not running, making LFO freerun mode not working properly in some cases
-   Fixed cases where deleting nodes in MSEG LFO mode could lead to a broken envelope
-   Modulation List can now launch a value edit typein with the pencil icon
-   Step Sequencer's Deform slider now has deform types, which brings Shortcircuit's LFO Smooth method to Surge
-   Adjusted the S&H modulator so that the initial state is random, leading to less uniformity in the first few phases
-   Changed the order of voice initiation and LFO EG Attack in Latch mode so a latch more accurately represents the voice

## Microtuning

-   Tuning Editor now contains the ability to create even division scales and three-note specified KBM files directly
-   Fixed a problem where MPE pitch bend in MPE mode with MTS enabled was using the wrong tuning system
-   "Use MIDI Channel for Octave Shift" tuning mode no longer conflicts with MPE mode
-   The Interval Between Notes display now makes it easier to see which interval you are playing

## Larger Bugfixes

-   We initialized the audio processing state too early, which in some cases could result in the patch resetting when loading the plugin in Logic Pro
-   We incorrectly handled patch loading in the startup path of Reaper, meaning loading a Reaper session with disabled Surge track(s) would never load the
    state correctly, and subsequently resaving without activating the track would save the incorrectly initialized state

## Surge XT Effects Plugin

-   Complete accessibility review
-   Implemented UI resizability through corner drag, menu and keyboard shortcuts
-   We now correctly report parameter names to host for the VST3 plugin
-   Double-clicking a parameter will now reset it to the default value
-   Added an option to run the plugin in zero latency mode - useful if your DAW can guarantee sending fixed block sizes to the plugin
-   Fixed Effect type menu not repainting during host automation
-   Airwindows Type parameter is now streamed and unstreamed properly, so that projects don't break if we add new Airwindows effects
-   Fixed a problem with integer streaming, which means that, going forward, changes in integer param ranges in Surge will not break Surge XT Effects sessions

## UI, UX and Skin Engine Changes

-   Royal Surge skin has been updated to fully match Surge XT feature set!
-   Touchscreen mode improvements, which includes automatically using the Exact mouse sensitivity mode and long press support
-   Typein for FM3 oscillator's Ratio parameter is correctly read when typing in a modulation amount
-   Typing an out of range value for a parameter or modulation amount typein will now report the appropriate minimum or maximum value
-   Audio In sliders that are unused will now appear deactivated (semi-transparent)
-   Ctrl+click on a currently unselected LFO modbutton will bring that modulator to focus in the lower area (same as clicking the orange arrow, but now you have a larger hitzone to do it)
-   More consistent FX slot mouse gestures:
    -   Double-click on FX slots will now bypass them (previously this was on right-click)
    -   Right-click now pops up the more usefulFX presets menu
    -   Single click works as it always did
-   The state of "Store Tuning in Patch" checkbox in the Save Patch dialog is now remembered after cancelling the dialog
-   3D waveform display for Wavetable and Window oscillators - toggled by clicking the oscillator display (or via right-click context menu)
-   Context menus will now scale properly on Windows HiDPI displays
-   Add contextual help links in severeal places which were missing it
-   Context menu colors can now be set in skins
-   Added option to use OS dark mode setting for context menu colors, which overrides skin-defined colors
-   Skin engine can now override the global font used by Surge XT
-   Added skin connectors for placing the new overlay windows (filter and waveshaper analysis)
-   The entire Classic skin (including hovers and tempo sync assets) is now contained inside the binary
-   Added pitch bend and modulation wheel widgets to the virtual keyboard
-   Correctly constrain plugin window drag-to-resize events
-   Waveshaper Analysis overlay now uses the actual Drive parameter for a realtime overview
-   The Modulation List now has new filtering options - by scene and by target parameter's control group
-   Most tearout windows can now be freely resized
    -   Double-click on torn out window's title bar reverts to the default size
-   Improve error message to be clearer in the (very rare) situations where the patch database is locked by two Surge XT instances
-   The About-screen-as-skin-layout-grid feature is back! We completely forgot to port it over from Surge 1.9!
-   Fixed a bug where the Zoom menu wouldn't allow setting default zoom level, if default zoom level wasn't at all defined
-   Wavetable oscillator's Morph parameter displayed wrong units in continuous and discrete modes
-   Mute and Solo buttons no longer overlap, which created uncertainty in which parameter actually gets clicked
-   Pressing the F1 key will now open the relevant part of the manual for currently focused (or hovered) parameter
-   Added Sustain button to the virtual keyboard
-   Make PNG loading lazy, which resolved sporadic crashes with skins that use PNGs, like Royal Surge
-   Improve Alias Harmonics editor mouse handling when mouse cursor is out of editor's bounds
-   Imporved tearout behaviour, adding an Always On Top pin button in the title bar
-   Patch comment popup width will dynamically adjust its width to fit longer comments now
-   Mousewheel in FX and Oscillator menus properly advances through submenus

## Other Changes and Various Fixes

-   Polyphonic aftertouch is now properly processed per MIDI channel
-   Removed the Activate Scene Outputs option, which is not needed anymore due to JUCE's plugin wrapper handling
-   Favorites can now be exported and imported via .surgefav files (in essence these are CSV files with a new extension)
-   Correctly report VST3 bypass parameter and implement it in our JUCE processor
    -   This should allow FL Studio's Randomize feature to stop disabling audio, and allow other VST3 hosts to bypass Surge XT as expected
-   Modbutton orange arrow state was incorrect on selection (but correct on drag gestures)
-   Fixed a bug when dragging FX slots with modulation assigned
-   Dropping a modulator on an overlay would modulate the slider underneath the overlay
-   Fixed a case where copying a modulation could duplicate a modulation routing
-   With the move to VST3 plugin bundle file format, Windows portable installs broke, so now they work again!
-   Drag and drop in the presence of overlays could corrupt Z-order of things
-   "Download Additional Content" link in the main menu didn't work, so now it works again!
-   "Absolute" option was not preserved when copying oscillators, scenes, etc.
-   We're now sending automation events from several widgets which didn't do that, leading to inconsistent automation in Cubase
-   Special characters like `'` no longer break the SQLite search. No [little Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/) here!
-   WAV chunks must have an even number of bytes, so we've fixed our WAV parser for the case when the size is odd, preventing incorrectly reading the file - which could happen with certain metadata chunks
-   Upgraded MTS-ESP library, which allows MTS-ESP to work on Linux
-   Tuning Library can now deal with fractions up to 2^64 for numerator and denominator in SCL/KBM files

## Infrastructure and Code Changes

-   We're making a substantial effort to move critical parts of Surge XT into libraries that other projects can use
    -   `sst-plugininfra` provides XML, filesystem, user preferences and keyboard shortcut management, CPU information and more
    -   `sst-cpputils` provides a collection of C++17 extensions we use a lot
    -   `sst-filters` provides all Surge XT filters in a header-only set of templates - used as a submodule now
    -   `sst-waveshapers` provides all Surge XT waveshapers in a header-only set of templates - used as a submodule now
-   Test case runtime substantially improved
-   Use `std::thread` everywhere for threading
-   Lots of improvements for the Windows installer
-   Reinstated Windows portable mode by checking recursively for SurgeUserData etc. folders
-   Use 7Zip for packing Windows ZIP files in the pipeline
-   Linux 'plugins only' archive is now a .tar.gz
-   The `.deb` file now contains icons and an application startup for Linux
-   Added CMake options to skip ALSA and/or VST3 builds
-   Various changes to support JUCE 7 builds (although our production build is still using 6.1.6 until further notice)
-   Fixed comments and documentation typos across the codebase
-   We now provide a cleaner compile-time error if building on a system other than x86 or ARM
-   Added ability to build a slightly reduced `surge-common` without JUCE or Lua (for the upcoming Surge Rack XT project)
-   Renamed the `surge-py` target to `surgepy` to avoid a `-`, which causes load time problems in Python
-   Made sure to cleanly join the background patch loading thread on exit if it is still running or if another patch load begins
