title: Changes in Surge XT 1.0.1
order: 2
id: 1.0.1
---

We have the best testers in the world, we really do. Surge XT 1.0 was nearly 1000 GitHub commits, almost every
part of the code changed, and our beta testers discovered almost every bug before we released. And we had
a lot of them. Those same testers found a few more bugs after we released, though, and a couple of them
were serious enough that we decided to collect up the first fortnight of finds and fixes and do a small point
release to give us time to get XT 1.1 together.

## Larger Bugfixes

-   The Formula modulator vector output would crash or go into an infinite loop with 8 or more output values. Fixed to report a single error message when we have more than 8 outputs
-   Fixed a crash when using vector modulators to modulate an FX slot and drag and drop to reordering effects
-   On macOS, the menu outline box was not painted, making menus visually confusing for many users. Fixed to have parity in how menus look vs Windows and Linux
-   Fixed a set of issues with the Windows installer which we found once more people actually ran the installer on various systems
-   If two MIDI events had an identical timestamp, the second and all subsequent MIDI events in that block would push to the end of the block causing potential block-length synchronization errors
-   The introduction of JUCE created a bypass parameter for VST3 plugins, which in some cases was improperly automated (especially in the FL randomizer). While we wait for a longer term fix, we made Surge XT continue to render when bypassed
-   While most of our help links pointed to the XT manual, the actual Menu > Manual link pointed to the old manual!

## Smaller issues and regressions from Surge 1.9

-   In touchscreen mode, always use Exact mouse sensitivity option
-   When modulating FM ratios, use a correct result if a typein retains the "C: " prefix
-   User patches without categories will now appear in an uncategorized submenu (instead of not at all)
-   ZIP files for Windows builds are now created with 7zip, so that Explorer can now unpack them without any 3rd party unpackers
-   Rename the Tutorials skin category properly
-   The filter cutoff slider wouldn't visually reset when using the Reset to Keytrack Root option
-   MSEG draw mode was incorrectly remembered across different MSEG modulator instances
-   Dark skin had a graphical error in filter configuration graphic
-   Favorites and Search icons were added to the Dark skin

## Added a couple of XT 1.1 features which were harmless to merge

-   Improved our testcase runtime
-   Removed some OS specific APIs for thread handling now that we are on C++17
-   If a multi-channel .wav file is loaded as a wavetable, we will load only the left channel instead of erroring out
-   Ctrl-click on a modbutton will now arm a modulator without selecting it
-   Bring back certain patches from Luna that were in Surge 1.9
