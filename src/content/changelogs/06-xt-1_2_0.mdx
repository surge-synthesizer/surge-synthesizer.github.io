title: Changes in Surge XT 1.2.0
order: 6
id: 1.2.0
---

We released Surge XT 1.2.0 on April 10, 2023. As well as several new major features in tuning, visualization and
accessibility, this release brings several new developers contributing substantial changes to the project!

## Oscilloscope

-   Surge XT now has a built-in oscilloscope and spectrograph, based on s(m)exoscope from Smartelectronix!
-   Oscilloscope can be opened through right-click menu of the top-right output level meter, or through the main menu, Workflow submenu, or by pressing Alt+O (or Option+O on Mac)

## Tuning

-   Surge XT can now act as MTS-ESP provider (server), allowing the Surge XT Tuning Editor to provide tuning for all supporting clients in a session
-   Remediated yet more edge cases in our internal tuning, including keyboard mapping larger than a scale

## Accessibility

-   We have added Accesibility submenu to the main menu
    -   This menu contains "Set all recommended accessible features" option which basically turns on all the good stuff that
        a screen reader user would require
-   Modulation Editor focus is improved when adding a modulation
-   Quantized slider movements (Control+drag) now work with keyboard bindings (Control+up/down arrow) symmetrically
-   There is now an option to export the current patch as text (opens in Web browser) for sharing and quicker patch inspection
-   Improved the Alias oscillator's additive editor for screen readers by making it consistent with other controls and overlays
-   Patch Selector will now select the submenu for the category of a given patch by default
-   Improved name invalidation when arrowing through discrete menu parameters
-   Step Sequencer steps now have manual value typeins on right mouse click context menu
-   Added a keybinding (Alt+0 by default) to announce which tabs are currently selected across Surge's user interface, and which patch is loaded
-   Fixed an issue where Alt+, and Alt+. bindings could get stuck in the Patch Selector

## Plugin

-   Allowed a more flexible set of I/O mappings, which fixed an interaction between a JUCE, Ardour and Surge XT which could silence VST3 plugin in some situations
-   Skipped VST3 context menu extensions in Reason, where they seem a bit dicey still
-   Added parameter name invalidation on patch change to refresh automation displays
-   Correctly implemented CLAP_NOTE_CHOKE
-   Corrected a problem with the virtual keyboard in the CLAP version of the plugin
-   Added appropriate buffering for the audio input for hosts where block size is not a multiple of Surge XT's internal process block size. This stops input buffer
    corruption with non-fixed sized blocks in FL Studio, at the cost of input buffer latency of 32 samples
-   Added a single entry point for note-matches-channel-key-voice-id, allowing the rare case of per-channel polyphonic modulation in CLAP to work

## Surge XT Effects

-   Implemented handling of block sizes that are not multiples of 32 samples more elegantly
-   Default settings for Reverb and Delay effects are more usable
-   Parameters for Airwindows effects will now be properly shown even if no audio engine is running

## UI/UX

-   Filter analyzer now lets you modify the cutoff and resonance simultaneously by simply dragging across the plot, XY pad style
-   Output level meter can now show CPU usage optionally (right-click the level meter to show context menu with options)
-   Alt+click on an FX slot will now clear it
-   Typeins for certain continuously togglable parameters (like Freeze in Nimbus or Knock in Spring Reverb) now work
-   Added a license field to the Save Patch dialog
-   Added an action to initialize patch (not bound to a key by default)
-   Modulation List now has a button to copy all assignmets to clipboard
-   Several virtual keyboard actions are now in the Keyboard Shortcut Editor (octave up/down, velocity up/down 10%)
-   Modal overlays will now have a semi-transparent background (it was solid color before)
-   Fixed jog order for wavetables to match display order in all cases
-   Visual display of modulation state is now going to be correct after using Paste scene option
-   LFO display will now be repainted when automation changes LFO parameters
-   Filter analysis overlay will now be repainted when automation changes filter parameters

## DSP

-   Noise generator can now be dropped to mono in all stereo filter configurations (right click the Noise Color slider)
-   More work done to support process block sizes that are lower than 32 samples - especially fixing a zippering issue in block-wise interpolators used in the mixer
-   Nimbus resampler now works at very high sample rates (or low block sizes)
-   Added clamps to all Twist oscillator parameters, which means modulation can no longer make it fail to produce sounds
-   Added a clamp to Airwindows FX type parameter in order to fix an occasional crash

## Modulation

-   Modulation now works on Unison Detune parameter of Ring Modulator effect
-   Added an option to scale additional LFO outputs by Amplitude parameter (found in Switch to... submenu in modbutton context menu)
-   Fixed step sequencer fast drags and out of bounds drags when holding Control
-   Fixed a bug where a constant MSEG segment with an AEG or FEG trigger would send the trigger on every block, instead of just the first one

## MIDI

-   Added an option to ignore MIDI Program Change messages
-   Clamped MIDI CC/pitch bend smoothers to avoid an infrequent extreme instability under some very rapid (computer-generated) changes

## Other Changes and Bug Fixes

-   Internal dialog titlebar buttons are consistent on macOS (left-aligned instead of right-aligned)
-   Fixed incorrect deserialization of "Precise tuning" setting for comb filters
-   Overlay tearout state is now separately stored for standalone and plugin versions
-   Fixed a minor UI issue where setting up modulation for LFO parameters would blink when pressing the down arrow on the modbutton and switching LFOs
-   Fixed a problem which left extra uninitialized padding at the end of streamed oneshot wavetables (this was not audible, it just looked incorrect)
-   Truncated wavetables no longer add noise to the final imported wavetable
-   Single cycle wavetables had a clamping error which could trigger an assertion in production builds on Arch Linux and other GCC builds with runtime checks enabled
-   Surge XT will now close all open menus when destroying the GUI editor, which means lingering menus longer result in a crash when closing the plugin window
-   Fixed a bug where a .modpreset in the root menu of the Modulation Presets area would crash Surge XT
-   Show a warning and silence output rather than crash in case when Surge XT is incorrectly handed a mono output buffer (which could happen in some Mac configurations with
    Bluetooth headphones)

## VCV Rack Related Changes (and other non-plugin clients of the code)

-   Allowed retriggering from non-zero values for LFO EGs
-   Provided a function to give a frame size to an untagged WAV (not exposed in Surge XT interface yet)
-   Allowed Treemonster to output the pitch and envelope it detected
-   String Oscillator would leak memory if an instance was initialized twice. Surge XT didn't do this, but Rack did
-   Added the ability to compile without Airwindows, SQLLite or MTS-ESP
-   Updated CMake rules for `simde` and JUCE allowing yet more indirection and choice
-   Allowed `SurgeStorage` to be more flexibly configured in context other than Surge XT synthesizer, such as VCV Rack and SUrge XT Effects plugin
-   Added an option to explicitly skip third party wavetable scans
-   Corrected the bug in Twist oscillator's LPG optionally, activated the fix for VCV Rack use only (for now)

## Infrastructure

-   Make build on GCC12 and MinGW on Windows
-   `surge-common` can now build for RISC-V and WebAssembly
-   Continued to modernize the codebase, moving to proper copy and assignment constructors on core classes, rather than `memcpy`
-   Moved many C-style strings to `std::string`
-   Build if an external build system adds AVX flags to the build
-   Added `pffft` as a submodule
-   Python binding updates
    -   Updated to pybind 11
    -   Exposed `mpeEnabled` and `tuningApplicationMode`
    -   Add build wheels for `cibuildwheel`
    -   Made `surgepy` an installable Python package
-   Surge XT testrunner will fail quickly and explicitly if resources are not available
-   Added an API for `SurgeImageStore` to get a `JuceImage` for JUCE-specific uses
-   Lots of small warning cleanups across the codebase
-   Non-parameter sliders can now have tooltips

## Content

-   Replaced factory templates with explicitly CC0 licensed patches
-   Updated the LinnStrument MPE patches
-   New third party wavetables from A.Liv
-   Fixed Init FM2 and Init Square templates so that they don't have filters bypassed
-   Cleaned up Lua syntax in Formula modulator tutorials
