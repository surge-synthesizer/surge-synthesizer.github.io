## Headline Changes

-   In 1.2.0 we have corrected a problem with audio input for irregular block sizes, but we warned about this
    situation too loudly and way too often - the warning is now moved to the audio input oscillator
    screen (in 1.2.2; in 1.2.1 it is on every oscillator screen), but the feature is kep
-   Renaming a patch could cause a race condition in our patch database - especially on Linux systems -
    causing a simple rename to show a large number of database lock errors - this is now fixed

## Tuning

-   Pitch slider set to 0 in Absolute mode now tunes correctly with Scala tuning files loaded

## Modulation

-   Fixed pitch bend becoming stuck when toggling MPE mode during held bent note
-   Made sure Portamento set to 0 is strictly 0 in all modes

## UI/UX

-   Clearing FX slot or chains will now disable bypass if a slot or slots were bypassed
-   Dragging a node in MSEG shows a value tooltip
-   Fixed font difference after typein for VKB Tempo field
-   Fixed a problem where Oscilloscope improperly grabbed keyboard focus
-   Allowed envelope retrigger options for Latch play mode
-   Fixed a problem whereby the Tempo field in standalone didn't work in some cases

## Content

-   Added CC0 license to the Init Square template patch

## Infrastructure

-   1.2.3 contains our last binary distribution of the LV2 format. Going forward
    users needing an LV2 will need to self build. (1.2.1 is missing an LV2).
