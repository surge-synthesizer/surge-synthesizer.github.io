We released Surge XT 1.2.1 on April 29, 2023. This is a hotfix release which takes care of the following issues:

## Patch Browser

-   Fixed a race condition in patch database. Renaming a patch could cause a race condition (especially on Linux systems)
    which would result in showing a large number of database lock errors

## Tuning

-   Pitch slider set to 0 in Absolute mode now tunes correctly with Scala tuning files loaded

## Modulation

-   Fixed pitch bend becoming stuck when toggling MPE mode during held bent note
-   Made sure Portamento set to 0 is strictly 0 in all modes

## UI/UX

-   Audio input latency warning is now moved to the oscillator display instead of a dialog
-   Clearing FX slot or chains will now disable bypass if a slot or slots were bypassed
-   Dragging a node in MSEG shows a value tooltip
-   Fixed font difference after typing in a value in Tempo field of virtual keyboard
-   Fixed a problem where Oscilloscope improperly grabbed keyboard focus
-   Allowed envelope retrigger options for Latch play mode
-   Fixed a problem whereby the Tempo field in standalone didn't work in some cases

## Content

-   Added CC0 license to the Init Square template patch
