order: 4
id: 1.6.0b8
---

-   Fix a major problem in the audio engine where QuadFilterChainState was uninitialized
    occasionally driving the filters unstable resulting in a large audio "Click/Pop" rather than
    sound
-   Fixed a memory leak where surge leaked 3 oscillator references on each voice

## Several improvements to the developer-only headless codebase

-   Headless can write wav files and read midi files
-   Headless can run stress tests

## New Content

-   Several new MPE factory patches
-   New organ wavetables from layzer

## Other Fixes

-   Wavetable and Window navigation arrows no longer pixelated at high zoom
-   Default XML stream fixed so MPE pitch bend default saves properly
-   HPF default set properly in all the init patches
