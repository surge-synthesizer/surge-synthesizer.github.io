## VST3 Host

-   The VST3 Host was substantially improved in this version
-   Support note velocity, pitch bend, midi controllers, modulation, and MPE
-   Support DAW automation correctly
-   Show parameter names correctly on Mac

## MPE

-   Mono voices no longer have stuck or mistuned notes
-   Menu allows setting of mpe pitchbend
-   5 factory patches in the MPE folder

## Wavetables and Effects

-   Add three wavetable packs from user layzer; "vocals" "PPG" and "morph"
-   Users can place their own .wt Wavetables in subdirectories in their User Data Folder and see them in the wavetable menu once surge restarts (macOS: "~/Documents/Surge/wavetables")
-   Third party wavetables are now present at Factory Data Folder (macOS: "/Library/Application Support/Surge/wavetables_3rdparty/")
-   Implement a python script to create and explode .wt files
-   Add an "Init" setting for each effect type
-   Take the chorus effects from "Delay/Chorus" and move them to "Chorus"; rename "Delay/Chorus" to "Delay"

## User Interface

-   Fix a problem with flickering in the Effects area
-   Fix elements which would dissapear on Linux in modulation mode
-   Update LFO TempoSync labels to include 1/128 and 1/256th notes
-   Both right and left button show wavetable menus
-   Fix the FM2 labels (it was previosly labeled "FM3")
-   Change WaveTable "Shape" parameter label to "Morph"
-   Set Controller To... -context menu now accurately shows CC#0 - CC#127 and is split by 20s
-   Fix a VST zoom problem where repeated zoom in and out could make the surge "walk" inside the frame
-   About menu now lets you open a Finder / Explorer for "Open User Data Folder" & "Open Factory Data Folder"
-   Make the about screen use Lato font
-   Supress the ctrl-click-reset gesture in LFO (which meant ctrl-click in step sequencer lost changes)

## Other Changes

-   Rename 32 bit surge dll "Surge_x86" on windows to avoid conflicts
-   Move the AU to the same zoom implementation as the VSTs
-   Add a headless app which plays all patches; build it with cmake
-   "OK/Cancel" dialog Linux (unimplemented) defaults to OK, allowing for patch overrides
-   Fix a problem where locales which didn't use "." as a decimal separator could not parse Surge patches
-   Update to developer documentation and some build tools
