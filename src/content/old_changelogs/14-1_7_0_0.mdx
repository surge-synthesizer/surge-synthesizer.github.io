order: 14
id: 1.7.0.0
---

1.7.0 is a major release done on July 28, 2020.

## Skin Engine

-   Surge now has a dark skin. Menu > Skins > Surge Dark
-   Surge is now runtime skinnable with swappable assets. Documentation on this skinning engine is
    forthcoming. For now if you want to author a skin, you are probably best to hop onto our Slack!
-   All synth elements in both skins get hover gestures to make the UI more reactive

## DSP and Synthesis Changes

-   New and Improved Effects
    -   Reverb 2, a new reverb based on a network of allpass filters and delays
    -   Flanger, a flanger with some extreme tuning and feedback options
    -   Ring Modulator, a simulation of an analog ring modulator with a choice of carrier waves based on Surge's Sine oscillator
    -   Rotary Speaker effect gets drive, rotor rate (previously it was coupled to existing horn rate), stereo width, and mix parameters.
    -   Fixed a phaser issue which caused instability at high modulation rates
    -   Fixed a Reverb 1 and 2 problem where the HF/LF damping could become unstable at high modulation values
    -   EQ gets a mix parameter, which can result in musically engaging phasing
-   Oscillator Improvements
    -   The Sine oscillator becomes a mini-synth
        -   Many more quadrant waveforms
        -   Unison mode
        -   Extended feedback range and negative feedback, which results in a square-like (rather than saw-like) waveform
        -   Built-in low and high cut filters
        -   The first 8 sine waveforms are ordered to match the TX-series waveforms
    -   Built-in low and high cut filters added to Window, S&H Noise and Audio Input oscillators
    -   You can route the output of Scene A into Scene B and mix it with Surge's audio input
    -   FM2/3 oscillators get extended feedback range and negative feedback for new instances
-   Other DSP Changes
    -   Unison goes up to 16 on all unison oscillators
    -   Surge uses the Surge Synth Team's tuning library used in several of our synths for SCL/KBM support
    -   Fixed a problem with phase overflow in very long running Sine and FM2/3 oscillators
    -   The Sine oscillator and Ring Modulator effect use a high performance approximation for sine/cosine waveforms (lower CPU usage)
    -   Fixed a crash with high sync values in the Classic oscillator when set to absolute pitch mode
    -   Fixed problems with the ADSR envelope becoming unstable or non-silent in very high or very low DS regimes

## Modulation and Voice Management Changes

-   Each voice LFO can now trigger filter and amplifier envelopes
-   You can 'deactivate' the LFO rate (right click the Rate slider to see the option in the context menu) which makes the LFO take a
    constant value at current phase, and makes the Phase slider act like a scrub operator
-   Step Sequencer UI rewrite
    -   Vector rendering
    -   Show the actual resulting curve
    -   Show value displays, right mouse drag to draw a ramp, quantize to scale length when holding Shift or Shift+Alt (twice the scale length)
-   Substantial improvements to Portamento
    -   Added Constant Rate and Constant Time modes
    -   Added logarithmic and exponential portamento curves (previously we only had linear)
    -   Added a glissando mode (portamento quantizes to scale degrees)
    -   Added a mode to retrigger envelopes when crossing scale degrees
    -   All these features are available when right-clicking the Portamento slider
-   Capped modulated envelope sustain at 1
-   Fixed a variety of issues with modulation phase which could, in extreme cases, cause glitches and noise
-   Clear FX parameter modulation when changing FX type to avoid unexpected modulations
-   Fixed a variety of situations where, in extreme inter-modulation cases (LFO1->2->3->1 etc.) LFO sources could go unstable.
-   Allow the amplifier and filter envelopes to modulate LFO parameters

## User Presets and Persistence

-   FX and MIDI mappings have user presets distinct from the patch/DAW stream
-   MIDI mappings are stored in the DAW state for recall
-   You can display the current MIDI mapping from the Menu

## UI Improvements

-   Every parameter links to context-specific online help
-   Discrete parameters (like filter type or tempo synced LFO rates) can now also be set via the right click context menu
-   Continuous parameters and their modulations can now be adjusted via text input dialog - click on the value readouts in the slider's right click context menu
-   Slider Ctrl-drag is properly quantized for values and for modulations
-   Updated units and display of many values and their modulations
-   LFOs in Envelope or Step Seq modes will be renamed to ENV or SEQ across the board, respectively
-   Labels, checkmarks, and ordering in menus more generally consistent
-   Added Zoom button in the Status panel with more consistent status panel menu behavior
-   Active hover gestures on buttons, sliders, and so on
-   High Precision Value Readout mode (Menu->User Settings) shows more decimals in popups and value input dialogs
-   You can browse FX presets with previous/next buttons, and see the name of the selected preset
-   Inactive sliders are transparent (Win/Mac) or have a hidden handle (Linux). Some sliders can be activated with Activate option in right click context menu

## OS-specific Improvements

-   Portable installation support on Windows (Surge will look for SurgeData and SurgeUserData folders next to the .dll/.vst3 first)
-   Substantial Linux UI improvements
    -   VSTGUI performance patched to substantially improve redraw time
    -   VSTGUI menus patched to open in a non-overlapping fashion
    -   Activate vector UIs for all components (LFO, Oscillator)

## Content

-   New patches from Jacky Ligon, many highlighting new features in 1.7
-   New patches from Dan Mauer
-   New patches from Psiome Send
-   Third party patches better organized and classified.

## ARM Support

-   The synth builds on Linux ARM platforms from source. Following the direction on the
    README you can build and run the LV2 or the VST3 and run them in both armv71 and aarch64
    PI platforms.

## Plugin Improvements

-   VST3 works reliably on Linux, including Reaper, Carla, Bitwig 3.2 and sample hosts
-   VST3 correctly orders multiple MIDI messages in the same sample chunk
-   Fixed a problem where the VST3 mis-rendered Macro DAW automation in Reaper
-   Added VST3 context menu facility to Macro controls
-   VST2/3 can output scenes to individual plugin outputs, prior to scene effects (not yet implemented in AU or LV2)
-   Fixed a bug with VST3 host menus which would crash Surge in some hosts (especially Bitwig on Linux)
-   AU advertises patch names to Logic Pro
-   LV2 reads screen scaling factors
-   DAW automation names contain scene label and are (mostly) uniquely named
-   VST3 (Windows) properly names MIDI extra parmeters
-   Fixed an error where some hosts in some situations would fail to load Surge patches stored as .vstpreset

## Minor Changes

-   Set Default Zoom... option now sets the default and the current zoom level
-   Many UI elements renamed to be more consistent across the board
-   Effects now have Init (Dry) and Init (Send) presets, the latter are intended to be used in Send FX slots
-   Fixed a bug which limited modulation on some Scene B modulation sources
-   SVG renderer supports radial gradients
-   Menu labels and capitalizations generally more consistent
-   Limit MIDI learn to sensible controllers
-   Use General MIDI CC names in context menus of Macros
-   Option to choose the octave offset of MIDI note 60 (default is C4, other options are C3 and C5) and it is applied consistently across the board
-   Developer Options menu is available on right click of the Menu
-   Cursor hiding is a togglable option on Windows
-   When reappearing from being hidden, mouse cursor is restored to the position from which the drag was started
-   Scrollwheel works on LFO type parameter
-   Parameter value popup no longer clips or draws offscreen
-   Popup prompts have titles and directions
-   You can set default author and default comment which will be automatically applied to the patches you save
-   Fixed a bug which caused the cursor to disappear on Windows when renaming a Macro
-   Show an error when loading an .fxp file from a synth other than Surge
-   Properly callibrate Windows mousewheel to work on integer sliders
-   Fixed a bug where switching a Scene LFO to and from a deformed Step Sequencer could mis-calibrate the LFO rate

## Infrastructure

-   Moved our entire build system to CMake
-   Fixed a bug where patches could incorrectly stream in international settings with "," as a decimal separator
-   Binaries are now properly licensed FOSS - disabled the VST2 builds
-   Better versioning strategy in various DLLs, plugins, and tools
-   Applied a variety of updates to our deb package
-   Move our Azure pipelines to macOS 10.14 (but still build for 10.12 and higher)
-   Tightened up some unit test thresholds to make them more reliable
-   Removed a large number of code warnings
-   Increased warnings-as-errors on macOS and squashed several warnings
-   The nightly deb installer starts version number with 9. instead of 0.
-   Renamed all 'master' code branches to 'main'.
-   Added a more correct copyright statement to each of the code files.
