title: Changes in Surge 1.6.0-beta-9
order: 5
id: 1.6.0b9
---

-   Move the entire UI to vector / SVG rendering for elements rather than bitmap
    rendering. This leads to cleaner pixel accurate zooms at all resolutions.
-   Fix a problem with VST3 where pitch-wheel was mis-centered, meaning
    any use of the pitch wheel stuck surge out of tune and some hosts
    (most notably Fruity Loops 20) were always a half step sharp in VST3.

## UI fixes and features

-   Correct a VST3 Mouse Wheel bug where, at some zoom settings, a mouse wheel
    would move an unrelated control slider.
-   Add user-selectable mouse speed settings allowing consistent speed by slider.
-   Add ability to re-scan all user folders when content has changed.

## Code Cleanups, API changes, and crash fixes

-   Fix a crash when midi program changes selected a patch out of bounds (but
    midi program change support is still inadequate)
-   Variety of code cleanups, including support for a headless build
    completely free of vstgui and vstsdk, and code changes to allow surge to
    build the dsp engine in the VCV Rack environment
-   Fix a variety of small memory and uninitialized errors.
-   Add a python script to dump a surge patch to stdout.
-   Add a File/Open dialog in the UserInteractions namespace.
-   Improved developer documentation on builds, git, and more.
