title: Changes in Surge 1.6.5
order: 12
id: 1.6.5.0
---

## New Features

-   Added a "Channel Split" mode to split by MIDI channel across scenes, just like the Key Split mode does across the keyboard
-   Several changes to the alternate tuning implementation
    -   We have full support for Scala KBM files, including full keyboard
        remapping, scale 0, and frequency 0 selection.
    -   The default tuning constant key is MIDI note 60 (261.63 Hz)
    -   The scale viewer shows frequencies per key
    -   Corrected an error where tuning could interfere with filter cutoffs and delay timings, especially with long scales

## Modulation Section

-   When any control is tempo synced, show a beats display as well as time display on the LFO grid (not available on Linux)
-   Tempo sync all controls for an LFO modulator with a single RMB gesture on any syncable control.
-   Added LFO Envelope lanes in the LFO 1 retrigger section. Use Shift-click or right-click on the retrigger section to trigger both the Amp and Filter envelope or just one or the other.
-   Made envelope retrigger work properly for Analog mode envelopes.
-   Chose a more on-theme blue for the step sequencer section, rather than that wierd green.
-   Green line shows how far you have modulated when you modulate a slider. Try it!

## MPE

-   The global pitch bend (on channel 1) no longer double-bends in MPE mode
-   MPE pitch bend state is per instance and saved in the DAW state, so you can use two Surges with MPE bend of 24 and 48 in a single project, if you happen to own both a Seaboard and a Linnstrument, say.

## VST3

-   Sidechain support is properly supported with a kAux channel, meaning sidechain works in Cubase Pro. Additionally, in Reaper versions > 6.02 the VST3 will properly configure routing for sidechaining when dragged into a track. (For earlier versions see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKR0x_dneYI).)
-   Support VST3 context menus. Right-click on a parameter in VST3 using a DAW that supports this feature and check it out!
-   VST3 automation for macros works.
-   LFO freerun works if transport is not running.

## Change the Windows Installation Locations

-   Windows now reads shared content from %PROGRAMDATA% (c:\ProgramData\Surge) and then if missing from %LOCALAPPDATA%
-   The Windows Installer installes common assets in %PROGRAMDATA%
-   To allow debugging, the About screen on all platforms shows the data paths.

## Other Workflow and Engine Improvements

-   You can export a wavetable from a patch to a standalone wavetable using the export menu item in the oscillator wavetable selector
-   The Envelopes in analog mode corrected decay behavior and support sustain swells
-   The Digital envelopes in quadritic decay mode work with sustain 0
-   LFO phase is properly modulatable (modulated phase is snapped when an LFO starts and is not modulatable once going)
-   TempoSync was not correctly unstreamed on the Delay effect.
-   TempoSync in Delay is correctly initialized when first played in a new DAW instance.
-   The AU unstreams zoom properly in Logic Pro
-   The AU allows automation of the "CC" and "Master" parameters properly

## Other UI Improvements

-   Windows Touch devices now work with the Surge UI
-   Fix a problem with a 'spiky' draw of the Square Wave on Windows
-   Several UI elements are higher contrast, several text displays are more consistently formatted
-   Frequency sliders (like Cutoff frequency) show a midi name as well as a frequency in their popups and string displays
-   TempoSync sliders show their status with a little "TS" on the handle.
-   FrameClose in the VST2 called at the appropriate time.
-   VST Names for FX Params are distinct per param

## Code Changes

-   Add and activate many unit tests spanning tuning, modulation, and much more
-   Add support for builds with Visual Studio 2019
