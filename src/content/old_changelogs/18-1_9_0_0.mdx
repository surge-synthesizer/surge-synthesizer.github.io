order: 18
id: 1.9.0.0
---

Surge 1.9 is a major feature expansion over January's Surge 1.8 release, including 4 new oscillator types, 15 new effects, a large number of microtuning
enhancements (including support for [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com/)), substantial new content including a set of patches tailor-made
for our new oscillators by Jacky Ligon, and much, much more. In more detail:

## New Oscillators

-   Modern, a low aliasing, clean waveshape oscillator based on extensive research into low aliasing waveform generation methods ([DPW](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224557976_Alias-Suppressed_Oscillators_Based_on_Differentiated_Polynomial_Waveforms) in this case)
-   Alias, a very, very digital oscillator based on ignoring extensive research into low aliasing waveform generation methods, which as a result gives lots of 8-bit joy
-   String, a waveguide-based feedback oscillator, perfect for creating all sorts of stringy, plucky, and plonky sounds
-   Twist, an oscillator based on a [rather famous Eurorack multi-oscillator module](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/)

## New Effects

-   Neuron, a distortion effect based on [Gated Reccurent Unit](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jatin/ComplexNonlinearities/gru.html), done by Jatin Chowdhury
-   CHOW, a [truculent distortion effect](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/CHOW), done by Jatin Chowdhury
-   Exciter, an effect based on a [rather famous aural exciter](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/Aphex_Exciter) unit, done by Jatin Chowdhury
-   Tape, a compact implementation of [Chow Tape Model](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel), done by Jatin Chowdhury
-   11-band graphical EQ
-   Resonator, inspired by a resonator unit from a very well-known vintage hybrid polyphonic synthesizer that rhymes with "vogue". Contains a few Surge-inspired additions like optionally allowing self-oscillation of resonators through modulation!
-   Combulator, a novel bank of 3 comb filters with feedback, additional noise exciter, separate output volumes for each comb, and individual panning for two out of three combs
-   Ensemble effect with several BBD modes and a clean delay mode, uses a very famous tri-phase dual LFO modulation setup
-   Nimbus, a live input granular processor with built-in reverb, based on [another rather famous Eurorack module](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/)
-   Treemonster, a really wild pitch-tracking ring modulator from Shortcircuit 2, proper Vember Audio classic!
-   Five new Airwindows effects - Galactic, Infinity, Verbity, MatrixVerb and TripleSpread
-   All these effects are also added to SurgeEffectsBank

## Other DSP changes

-   A large number of C++ and SSE improvements in the Sine oscillator, substantially improving performance
-   Oscillator drift now works properly for all oscillator types
-   Oscillator drift now starts at small non-zero random value for each unison voice, rather than starting from 0 (there is also an option to use the old behavior, right-click Osc Drift slider)
-   Character filter will work on new oscillator types (so it's not just for Classic oscillator type anymore - but it is still a global parameter for both scenes!)
-   Retrigger now works properly on all oscillator types
-   Surge now supports single-cycle wavetables (previously, a minimum of two frames were required for the wavetable to load correctly)
-   Wide is the default filter configuration for all templates and Surge's startup state
-   The Asymmetric and Digital waveshapers in the Distortion effect now work properly
-   You can now deactivate Delay R time to allow linking left and right delay times
-   Ring Modulator frequency is now displayed in Hz; also added Absolute mode
-   Reverb 2 now has the same minimum predelay value as Reverb 1
-   Phaser and Neuron can now both deactivate Rate of their internal LFO, in which case modulating Rate will scrub the LFO's phase for manual phasing/combing effects
-   Added 4 new waveshapes in the Sine oscillator
-   More effect types now properly respond to All Notes Off message
-   Hard clip can be configured and set per scene or globally, with new settings at 0 and +18 dBFS (which is the default setting as it were before). You can set this by right-clicking the scene or global volume sliders, or additionally by right-clicking the A/B boxes in the FX grid
-   Sine, FM2 and FM3 oscillator types now have extended range for Feedback parameter by default
-   Maximum polyphony parameter is now actually read from the patches on load (Surge always did store the chosen max polyphony value into the patch, it was just never loaded!)
-   Global Volume doesn't apply to individual scene outputs anymore
-   Added deactivation toggles to low/high cut filters across all effects that didn't have them so far

## Alternate Tuning / Microtonal Interface

-   Provide two tuning application modes: Tuning applied at MIDI input, or after modulation. This is described in detail in the manual. By default, it is set to apply at MIDI input for new patches
-   Filter cutoff can now be tuning-aware
-   Currently loaded SCL/KBM files are now displayed in Tuning menu
-   Far clearer internal and user state management on tuning (= scale + mapping), scale, and mapping management
-   KBM name is now stored in patch and DAW state
-   Tuning is now interpolated in log2 space rather than linear space for more accurate inter-note tuning
-   And finally, thrilled to be one of the first synths to integrate [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com) as a tuning source

## User Interface

-   Reposition Author/Category fields in the factory skins, not to overlap with longer patch names
-   Hover effect is now available on more assets, for example oscillator type menu and FX grid
-   Retrigger and Keytrack button have a right-click option to set their value for all oscillators in a scene
-   Phase/Shuffle parameter now changes its label based on LFO type (will show Shuffle only when Step Seq is selected)
-   Patch browser left-click menu now has multiple columns (Windows only!)
-   Control/Command-drag on sliders to snap to units now works for modulation amounts
-   Control/Command-click on patch or category previous/next buttons will load a random patch!
-   Expanded use of menu for integer sliders in some cases
-   Groups of sliders can now be deactivated collectively, for example in EQ and Tape effects, Twist oscillator...
-   Added an option to always show maximum amplitude LFO as a dotted line (User Settings > Value Displays > Show ghosted LFO waveform reference)
-   Option to drag bottom right corner to resize (VST3 only) is not displayed anymore for skins that have defined fixed zoom levels (i.e. Royal Surge)
-   Added a UI refresh when changing filter type via host automation
-   "Add Modulation From..." option now has its entries organized in submenus per modulator type
-   Removed a check if factory patches are installed. Now it's possible to completely remove all factory/3rd party patches if one wants to, and only focus on making one's own patches with a clean slate!
-   Envelope LFO presets are now saved to Envelope subfolder (previously they went to LFO subfolder)

## Plugin Wrappers

-   AU advertises MPE support now
-   Label all AU parameters as high resolution
-   Disable VST3 parameter name resets which was coded incorrectly in Surge, causing problems in Bitwig
-   VST3 implements `getParamNormalizedByString`, allowing DAW-side value typeins to be consistent with Surge
-   VST3 bug with `getParameterString` fixed, correcting incorrect string display in some cases in Bitwig

## Skin Engine Changes

-   Far clearer skin component model
-   Add a developer mode option (right click Menu button) to overlay a grid on top of Surge's GUI at runtime as a helper tool when designing, with support for arbitrary grid size
-   Fixed some bugs pertaining to user-specified parameter groups
-   Introduced skin version 2 for all the below mentioned new skin engine features:
    -   Skin labels can show values from parameter names (useful for i.e. oscillator and FX parameters, which dynamically change their name based on oscillator/FX type)
    -   Skin labels can now have an image assigned
    -   Oscillator type and FX grid assets now only contain the backgrounds, any text on them is now generated through code
    -   Slider class now has font size and text offset properties
    -   Added skin properties for positioning the patch browser
    -   Added a skin color for showing the current value of a macro more prominently
    -   Added skin colors for About page text, column text, link and hovered link

## New Content

-   Patches and FX presets from Vospi
-   FX presets from Arty
-   New patches from Databroth
-   Updated Jacky Ligon patches to set default tuning mode and adjust maximum polyphony
-   Expanded tuning library from Jacky Ligon

## Smaller Changes

-   Show the plugin file location on About screen
-   Show the full modulator name in inter-LFO modulations
-   Show tne entire MSEG curve in Rate deactivated mode
-   When copying an oscillator, remember current position in the wavetable list index
-   About page shows your actual CPU model, not some build-time guess
-   The default value for scene Highpass cutoff parameter is minimum now (6.88 Hz)
-   Increase mouse hitzone on macro sliders slightly
-   Frequencies below C0 now have a proper negative-interval note name
-   Updated a few factory library patches that were using Latch mode by setting them to Mono mode, in order to avoid random noises when browsing through patches
-   Voice LFO Step Sequencer envelope triggers now run properly even without assigned modulation
-   Added a graphical asset for MIDI Learn, so it's now clearer to see when we're in MIDI learn mode and for which parameter
-   Handled a tuning regression when SCL files had a blank title in the first line
-   Next/Prev can span or constrain to category in patch navigation
-   All frequency-based parameters (except LFO rate) can now be set by typing in a note name (using 12-TET to convert to frequency)
-   Zoom level is no longer additionally saved in the DAW state - only the default value stored in user configurationi is used across DAW projects and all Surge instances
-   Wavetable export feature now correctly names the wavetable
-   Existing oscillator modulations are now cleared when changing oscillator type
-   When drag&dropping a patch onto Surge's UI, it is first checked if it exists among the current factory/3rd party/user patches, then that position is used as an anchor for previous/next patch buttons
-   Fixed a bug where loading a patch loaded wavetables twice, causing audio dropouts
-   Fixed a graphics memory leak on Linux, caused by difference in VSTGUI reference count between Linux and Windows/Mac
-   Fixed a bug when changing patches with previous/next patch buttons could skip multiple patches sporadically
-   Default MIDI learn settings are not stored to configuration.xml in factory data folder anymore, but in the always-writeable user data folder
-   When loading patches that contain invalid modulations (for example, Shape parameter in Sine oscillator has some modulation that was made possible in 1.8 and before through certain steps), make sure those modulations are removed to not create any trouble down the road

## Code cleanup

-   Reformatted the codebase with a new, far more sane, clang-format (no more 3 space tabs, and so on!)
-   Replaced our hand-rolled filesystem implementation with [gulak](https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem)
-   GUI overlay API (used for MSEG editor, Store Patch dialog, etc.) is now far more rational, so we can have more than one overlay showing at once
-   Rework `char` and `string` functions to avoid potential overflows in several cases
-   Common oscillator functions (drift, character filter, etc..) are now all found in a single place (OscillatorBase.h)
-   Slider bipolarity and deactivation is now handled in a [single API point](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/blob/main/doc/DynamicNameActivationBipolar.md)
-   Consistently named oscillator and FX related C++ files and classes
-   A non-global RNG used through most of the code where `rand()` was used before
-   Some memory leaks were plugged up!

## Infrastructure

-   More work done on UTF-8 file names and paths on Windows
-   Linux consistently uses `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` as a search path for assets
-   Surge on Windows can now be built with `mingw` or `clang` (but productoin builds are still using MSVC)
-   Linux reads config.xml from the filesystem
-   In Ardour on Linux, work around the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH / GTK2` issue which stopped Zenity from launching
-   Activate warnings-are-errors on Linux gcc
-   Windows implicit `precompiled.h` removed
-   Integrated [libsamplerate](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate) in the codebase, required for Eurorack-based modules which operate at a fixed sample rate of 48k
-   CMake will now run even if `git` is not found

## Surge XT

-   Lots of commits for Surge XT which will hopefully be released sometime this summer!
