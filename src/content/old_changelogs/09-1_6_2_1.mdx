1.6.2.1 is a point release fixing a few regressions in 1.6.2 and a few crashes our users noticed when more
people downloaded the synth.

-   Fix a long-standing MPE error where channel aftertouch was mis-routed
-   Restore the "extended" menu on Oscillator pitch; apply a few other cosmetic menu changes
-   Build patch menu correctly when user directory names exactly match factory directory names
-   On Linux systems without zenity installed, fail gracefully instead of SEGV
-   Apply naming consisntency to wavetables as well as patches
