cleanups

    -   Release velocity is now an available modulation source. See [more details here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnEX-ypuem0)
    -   Sustain Pedal in MPE mode was mis-mapped to the wrong channel, leading to it not working in MPE note-per-channel configurations
    -   The 'Drive' feature in the distortion effect is extensible

-   New Content

    -   A set of MPE patches for the Linnstrument provided by Roger Linn. [Here's a video of Roger demonstrating them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-mKyShEvKg&t=1s)
    -   Producer [Damon Armani](http://damon-armani.com) contributed a set of EDM & Dubstep Wavetables and Patches to the 3rd party library.

-   Other smaller changes

    -   Mouse button shows value of integer and boolean sliders
    -   Fix a small repaint bug in the LFO display
    -   Handle cases where user folders don't exist
    -   Make LFO modulation button state always consistent
    -   Better abbreviated names of modulation sources, with consistent case and spelling
    -   Failed wav file loads include the name of the file which failed
    -   Developer documentation cleanup and unit tests

-   1.6.4.1 was a minor release that corrected the installer on macOS Catalina, renamed and completed a couple of the new content packs and fixed two small graphics assets.
