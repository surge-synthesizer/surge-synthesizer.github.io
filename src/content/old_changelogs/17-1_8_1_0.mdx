title: Changes in Surge 1.8.1
order: 17
id: 1.8.1.0
---

Version 1.8.1 is a point release to clean up a few bugs we found after 1.8.0 release, to add a few features we simply forgot to code, and
to update and add content to the installer which people shared after the 1.8.0. release.

The changes are:

## Bugfixes and Features

-   Handled UTF-16 paths for saving user settings, allowing users on Windows with UTF-16 usernames to update their defaults
-   Drag and drop of a .wav or .wt wavetable doesn't reset oscillator type, if type is set to Window
-   The warning on Windows about uninstalled Lato font shows only once, not once every time the Surge GUI is opened
-   About screen actually mentions Surge Synth Team!
-   About screen on Windows shows "x86" instead of "Intel" for CPU
-   Modulation depth display and typein for tempo synced parameters is implemented now (as opposed to being just nonsense)
-   Subfolders in modulator presets are now listed first, before files
-   Dismissed the value display popup when toggling modulation assign mode on/off
-   Resolved Python with /usr/bin/env on Linux in the build phase
-   Fixed an occasional, but serious crash which would occur on slower machines when rapidly changing patches
-   Reordered and improved the MSEG segment menu
-   Drag and drop FX movement retains assigned modulation
-   Fixed a mis-drawn MSEG hover segment when scrolling horizontally
-   Added an explicit menu setting for touchscreen mode for Windows users (under User Settings->Mouse Behavior)
-   Avoided a floating point underflow which rendered MSEG S-curve deforms incorrectly when Deform was a very small value
-   Failure to load a .wav file will not rename the patch wavetable anymore
-   Fixed a typo which resulted in the Hard waveshaper sounding wrong in Rotary and Distortion effects

## Content

-   Added a bunch of modulator presets
-   High quality versions of all factory wavetables in Basic folder
-   Updated Jacky Ligon's presets with new patches and CPU optimizations
-   Updated TMNG's presets with new patches, CPU optimizations and cleaner wavetables
-   Added wavetables from TNMG
