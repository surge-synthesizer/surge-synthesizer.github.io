title: Changes in Surge 1.6.1.1
order: 7
id: 1.6.1.1
---

-   Fix two big concerns raised as people used 1.6.0

    -   Dynamically allocate wavetable loading memory so that large wavetables no longer crash (as fixed below) but small wavetables don't bloat memory on low mem systems.
    -   Fix two bugs in the VST3 zoom-dance supression which caused some versions of FL20 on Win to misdraw.

-   Add new modes to the Sin oscillator by quadrant masking and shifting and pitch doubling.
-   Several code-level changes to clean up warnings and make surge-rack easier.
-   Version 1.6.1.1 also contains a tiny fix which resolves a crash with re-opening zoomed windows in Logic which is not in 1.6.1
