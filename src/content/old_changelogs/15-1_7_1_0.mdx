title: Changes in Surge 1.7.1
order: 15
id: 1.7.1.0
---

So, testing is hard. We're a scrappy rag tag group of volunteers facing an army of
diverse operating systems, DAWs, environments, build flags, and so on. We're really happy
that all the new features in 1.7.0 worked! But upon release we found some of the environmental
stuff didn't, so we did a quick 1.7.1 release which includes the following fixes,
most of which were cause by us doing a substantial upgrade to our build infrastructure with
1.7.0. We still have a swath of features planned for the 1.7 series, and expect a 1.7.2 with
some new features and effects in Autumn 2020.

## macOS

-   Make the VST3 work in Abelton Live for Mac (by doing a blank-signing of the bundle)
-   Restore compatability back to OS 10.9 (by building macOS at C++-14 level).
-   Change the support file lookup semantic to always use the newest support files

## Linux and FreeBSD

-   Activate an Ubuntu-20 Clang-10 build and resolve bugs
-   Remove a set of warnings that stop Clang-9 from building, allowing Surge to build on FreeBSD again

## Windows

-   Modify the VST3 zoom failure handler, which would cause an infinite loop in zooms on Studio One in some situations.
-   Change our build pipeline so the 64-bit Windows installer installs the 64-bit SurgeEffectsBank

## All Platforms

-   Add greatly improved labels on value menus for filter subtypes and envelope attacks
-   Improve error messages for missing skins
-   Add a 'Zoom to Default' menu item which zooms to the user default setting
