title: Changes in Surge 1.6.6
order: 13
id: 1.6.6.0
---

Version 1.6.6 fixes several bugs and adds a few key features. We released so quickly after 1.6.5 since we want to take a pause on doing regular production releases while we
prepare for a Surge 1.7 release which will include (among other things) a skinning engine to allow designers to adapt
the UI. As such, this will be our last production release for a little while - perhaps until summer of 2020. Changes in 1.6.6 are

## Audio and Performance Changes

-   Absolute unison mode was both sample rate dependant and incorrectly calibrated. Corrected it so that, at all sample
    rates, a 16 Hz absolute unison is a 16 Hz unison spread.
-   Unison range can now be extended, giving unison spreads up to one octave (pitch) or 192 Hz (absolute).
-   Window Oscillator now supports FM, and is calibrated to use the same FM Depth as FM2/3/Sine oscillators.
-   We initialize modulators before the initial voice start, setting the first modulator value at voice initialization corectly and
    avoiding a 32 sample "sweep" across a modulator value at voice onset.
-   Fixed two bugs with the sustain pedal; first - sustain on channels 3 and 4 didn't work, and second - pressing a key
    multiple times while sustain was held would lead to an incorrect state.
-   Fixed a bug with the tuning engine where mappings with root keys far outside of scale ranges gave incorrect results
-   Made the oscillator display constant even in extreme tuning changes

## LV2 Changes

-   The LV2 had incorrectly advertised the identity of its ports. Change to use unique symbols for each port. _Unfortunately this fix will break prior Surge sessions, but those prior sessions inconsistently streamed the synth state in most LV2 hosts_
-   The LV2 didn't advertise all parameter changes leading to a port being unsynchronized.

## Minor Changes

-   The VST3 (Windows) plugin properly formats the automation display of the CC parameters
-   The FX slots and automation parameters are named more consistently, as are several menus and labels
-   The value popup window popsup on mouse-down not mouse-move on a slider
-   The patch and wavetable menus have refresh options on the popup menu, not just in menu/data and patches
-   Slider mouse behavior in medium and slow works more like classic when over-dragging
-   Added an init patch which assigns a distinct modulator envelope to each OSC
-   Added a regtest that parameter IDs are stable across versions
-   Modify the build pipeline so the linux .deb file has correct ownership on shared assets
-   Stream the Wavetable name into the patch
-   Correct the Open Tuning Library menu on Windows
-   Fixed a bug with opening and closing the VST2 on Linux
