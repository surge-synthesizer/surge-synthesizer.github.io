## Presets and Wavetables

-   Sub-folders in patches become sub-categories in menus.
-   Certain presets would glitch when multiple notes were played, these clicks and pops no longer happen.
-   Drag'n'drop of wavetable (.wt) to now works
-   Drag'n'drop of wavefile (.wav) to Surge now shoots an error instead of crashing
-   Preset and WaveTable subfolders are now sorted alphabetically instead of randomly.
-   Loading of presets works
-   Wavetable loading improved (all extensions capitalisation supported: .wt, .WT, .Wt, .wT - no longer only .wt and others ignored)
-   Pressing +/- next to Patch will select the next (not the 31th) and the previous patch accurately.
-   Pressing +/- next to Category will select the next (not random) and the previous category accurately
-   Wavetable Next/Previous arrows work accurately and allow for scanning through each and every wavetable in the wavetables-folder.
-   Switching patches no longer crashes
-   Storing of patches works - if you write on Name and click on Category - the Name no longer reverts to"previous name". Same with Category, Creator, Comment.
-   If you try to overwrite a patch that already exists, you will get an informative prompt to the tone of "this preset x already exists, are you sure?" (Mac and Win).
-   You can no longer save a preset with no name.
-   You can no longer save a preset into a category with no name.
-   Right-clicking on preset name will show all presets in that category.
-   Checkmarks added to Category and Preset (showing Category and selected Preset)
-   Checkmarks added to Wavetable (showing folder + selected wavetable)

## Zoom

-   Surge supports a zoomable UI on all platforms
-   You can now use + / -, cmd+ / cmd- to Zoom the interface
-   Classic Surge Skin has been re-done to be 1:1 but clearer and higher resolution bitmaps (less pixelation)
-   VSTGui Scaling bugs fixed
-   Maximum zoom, minimum zoom
-   Zoom, resize menu positioning issues fixed for Linux

## Other UI

-   LFO Waveform is displayed correctly
-   Wavetable is displayed correctly
-   All menus are correctly implemented
-   Modulation names can be accurately renamed (Mac and Win)
-   If you bind more than one parameter into a modulation, and remove the first parameter, the Modulation box updates to the correct parameter-name (Bind Cutoff, Bind Resonance, Remove Cutoff = Modulation box no longer says "Cutoff").
-   If you Clear All binds from a Modulation box (Bind Cutoff, Clear All) - the Modulation box updates to "-", no longer stays as "Cutoff" even with no bind.
-   Polyphony count was inaccurate and updated only when the area was clicked, now updates in real time.
-   Polyphony count does not fluctuate while notes are being played
-   Use Lato -font for macOS + Windows
-   Umlauts ä/ö/å are correctly displayed in folder names.
-   Surge now uses a VST3SDK VSTGUI with additional fixes

## Hosts

-   VST2 / AU automation (bind parameters to DAW) learning works accurately (no longer spews forth a correct parameter and a wrong one)
