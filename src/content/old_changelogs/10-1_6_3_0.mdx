title: Changes in Surge 1.6.3
order: 10
id: 1.6.3.0
---

1.6.3 fixes a collection of problems with the VST3 plugin. We are particularly grateful to the team
at Steinberg for providing us a complementary copy of the Cubase DAWs which best exhibited the VST3 bugs
Surge had, and allowed us to resolve the problems.

## VST3 Fixes galore

-   Pitchwheel and Modwheel work VST3/Cubase
-   Resolved bugs in midi mapping, midi learn, and other controller flows
-   Resolve VST3 automation inconsistently updating the Surge UI
-   Support drag-to-zoom in VST3 in hosts which support it (tested in Reaper, FL, Bitwig and Cubase)

## Upgraded the distortion effect

    -   Users can select the waveshaper for the drive stage from the set of surge waveshapers
    -   The pre- and post- gain can be extended to allow outsized boosts and subsequent extreme distortions
    -   Note that some settings of the distortion effect in extended mode can drive Surge well into digital clipping. Be careful!

## Other fixes

-   New patches from Inigo Kennedy
-   Several LV2 and Linux changes, including the ability to build a 32 bit linux configuration.
-   Deal with some small bugs with wave ordering, invalid waves, menu arrow keys on Linux, and error handling when Surge is mis-installed
