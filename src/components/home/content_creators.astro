                If you love to use Surge XT and make amazing presets or music,
                we want to hear from you!
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, we would love to have you pitch in and help out with
                the project!
            </p>
            <p>
                We are looking for people that have content which showcases
                Surge XT in all of its glory.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you make patches, write entire songs using only Surge XT or
                anything in between, we would love for you to be involved!
            </p>
