    <p>
        We love Surge XT. We <strong><em>also</em></strong> love people.
    </p>

    <p>
        Community is a <strong><em>big thing to us</em></strong> on this project. We want an inclusive,
        positive, and happy community with contributions from a large set of differing viewpoints and
        backgrounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's be kind to each other and treat each other with respect. It takes all of us working
        together to make the community great.
    </p>

    <p>We are looking forward to your insights and contributions.</p>

    <p>Let's make something amazing!</p>
