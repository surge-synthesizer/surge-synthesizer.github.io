            <h1>One Synth Challenge,</h1>
            <h1 style="font-family: initial">❤️❤️❤️</h1>
            <h1>Thank YOU!</h1>
            <p>
                We think it's pretty cool that you picked Surge for the One
                Synth Challenge. And then did it again a few more times!
            </p>
            <p>
                Surge was in the spotlight of OSC #122, #138 and most recently,
                #159. A talented group of musicians created all these tracks
                using Surge as the only sound generating device. Or - in some
                exceptional cases - only Surge Effects plugin was used, much to
                our awe and amazement!
            </p>
            <p>
                Do give these tracks a listen, as we think they are a brilliant
                showcase of flexibility and amazing range of sounds that Surge
                offers.
