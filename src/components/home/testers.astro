                Testing is a way that everyone can help contribute. All you would need to do is
                install a copy of Surge XT and use it in your own workflow.

                There are so many combinations of operating systems and DAWs that it is <em
                    >really difficult</em
                > to make sure everything gets tested under all contexts.
