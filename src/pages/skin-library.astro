        <p>
            Many folks in the Surge XT community make skins beyond the few we
            ship with. This page contains a set of curated skins from community
            designers available for you to download.
        </p>

        <p>
            Installing a skin in Surge XT is very simple - simply drag the
            downloaded ZIP file onto a running instance of Surge XT, and you're
            done!
        </p>

        <p>
            Although we endeavour to make sure these skins are working, and also
            try to make sure they contain no inappropriate content, please use
            them at your own risk and understand that support for errors in them
            may be less available than for the factory skins.
        </p>
