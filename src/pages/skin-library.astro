                Many folks in the Surge XT community make skins beyond the few we ship with. This
                page contains a set of curated skins from community designers available for you to
                download.
            </p>

            <p>
                Installing a skin in Surge XT is very simple - simply drag the downloaded ZIP file
                onto a running instance of Surge XT, and you're done!

                Although we endeavour to make sure these skins are working, and also try to make
                sure they contain no inappropriate content, please use them at your own risk and
                understand that support for errors in them may be less available than for the
                factory skins.
