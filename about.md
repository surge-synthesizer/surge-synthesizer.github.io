## Surge


This is the synthesizer plug-in Surge which (@kurasu) Claes Johanson previously sold as a commercial product as the company vember audio.

As he is too busy with other projects and no longer wanted to put the effort into maintaining it across multiple platforms, he decided to give it new life as an open-source project.

It was originally released in 2005, and was one of Claes' first bigger projects. It is reliable and sounds great.

The codebase was migrated from before an unfinished 1.6 release, which improves on the last released 1.5.3 in a number of ways:

It uses a newer version of the VSTGUI framework
This has caused a lot of graphical bugs, with some still needing to be fixed
But it will enable the creation of a port for both 64-bit macOS and Linux
Support for VST3
Support for MPE
New analog mode for the ADSR envelopes
Surge currently builds with Windows and macOS (AudioUnit,VST2,VST3), and getting it to build on Linux again should be doable with some effort.

An official release-page with installers for Windows 64-bit, macOS 64-bit VST2/VST3/AU format versions of Surge exists at https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/

System requirements
At least Pentium 4 CPU.
64-bit Windows or macOS.
