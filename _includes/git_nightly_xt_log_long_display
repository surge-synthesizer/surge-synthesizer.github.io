Skeleton for a CLI Build (#7101)

This is the skeleton for a JUCE CLI version of Surge-XT,
which will allow zero gui command line intiiated standalone
sessions (a "headless player").

Right now it doesn't do much. This commit is to put the
plumbing in place and frankly make sure it builds in CI!
