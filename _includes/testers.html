                <em>Know any testers? Umm, asking for a friend.</em><br /><br />Testing is a way that everyone can help
                contribute. All you would need to do is install a copy of Surge.<br /><br />There are so many
                combinations of operating systems and DAWs that it is <em>really difficult </em>to make sure everything
                gets tested under all contexts. <br /><br />If you would like to get involved jump in over here:<br />
