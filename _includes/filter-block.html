                Open-source additions to our filter bank contain: K35 and Diode Ladder filter types from Odin 2
                synthesizer, 12 and 24 dB/oct multimode filters from OB-Xd, and weird but fascinating Cutoff Warp,
                Resonance Warp and Tri-Pole filters by Jatin Chowdhury!

                Filters can self-oscillate (with excitation) and respond amazingly fast to cutoff frequency changes.
