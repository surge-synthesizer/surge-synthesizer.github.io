        <h4 class="oscheading-2">
            We think it&#x27;s pretty cool that you picked Surge for the One Synth Challenge.<br />
            <br />A group of musicians over at OSC created these songs using Surge 1.6 only!<br /><br />Do give them a
            listen!<br />
        </h4>
        <h4 class="oscheading-2">
            As great things are bound to repeat themselves, Surge was chosen as the featured synth once again, for OSC
            138! This time, it was Surge 1.7 taking all of the sound generation duties. That just means there is even
            more music featuring Surge available for your listening enjoyment!<br />
