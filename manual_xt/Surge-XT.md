# Getting Started
Thank you for using **Surge XT**\!

Surge XT is a virtual synthesizer originally released as "Surge" into
open source by creator Claes Johanson in September 2018. Since then, it is maintained by a group of volunteers.

This first section is intended to give you a brief overview of some concepts
that are specific to this synthesizer and an introduction on how to navigate,
manipulate, and use Surge XT to its full potential.

For detailed information regarding the synthesis engine and other advanced technical
specifications and options of this synthesizer, there is a second section dedicated to
[Technical Reference](#technical-reference).

Finally, for more tips and tricks, tutorials, and to download additional content, you can also take a look at [Surge's wiki](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki).



<br/>
<br/>

## Installing or building Surge XT
*Audio Units, AU is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc  
VST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH*

Surge XT's installer is available at [https://surge-synthesizer.github.io](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io).


### Windows

On the Windows platform, Surge XT is delivered as both a 32 or 64-bit VST3 plug-in instrument.

The filename for the VST3 is `Surge XT.vst3`.

System Requirements:

  - Windows 7 or newer
  - A reasonably fast CPU (Pentium 4/Athlon 64 or above)
  - At least 4GB of RAM
  - VST-compatible host application

In addition, to use the 64-bit version  on Windows you need the following:

  - A CPU supporting the x64 (AMD64/EM64T) instruction set
  - A **64-bit** version of Windows
  - An application capable of hosting 64-bit VST plug-ins

The VST3 version of the plug-in should be automatically installed in the default VST3 plug-in location and
should be found by your host application. However, the Windows version also comes with a **portable mode**:

- Portable Mode allows you to store assets in the same directory as your Surge XT.vst3.
- If Surge XT.vst3 is installed in a folder and in that same folder there is a directory called `SurgeXTData`, Surge XT will use that for factory data rather than `%PROGRAMDATA%\Surge XT`.
- If in that same folder there is a directory called `SurgeUserData`, Surge XT will use that for user data rather than `%DOCUMENTS%\Surge`.
- Either none, one, or both of those folders can be there. Surge XT will fall back to the defaults if they are not present.
You can always see your data paths in the [About screen](#about-surge).


<br/>
### macOS

On Mac, Surge XT is delivered as a 64-bit Plug-in Instrument for both the Audio
Unit (AU) and VST Plug-in interfaces (VST3).

System Requirements:

  - Mac OS X 10.11 or newer
  - A 64-bit Intel CPU
  - At least 4GB of RAM
  - 64-bit AU or VST-compatible host application

To install, run the packaged installer. You will be given the option of automatically installing the
AU `Surge XT.component` and the VST3 `Surge XT.vst3` to their correct locations.
The factory presets and wavetables will also be automatically installed.

Running the packaged installer will install Surge for all of the users of your
Mac.

<br/>
### Linux

On Linux, Surge is available as a 64-bit VST3 in the form of a **deb** and **RPM** package.

The system requirements can be hard to determine, as there are a lot of distributions out there and other factors.
However, the following information might be good to know:

 - The installation package on **Surge XT's website** is in the form of a Debian package
 - The distribution package is built on Ubuntu 18.04
 - The packages required are listed in the source and in the deb file

**Note:** Some actions in Surge XT are done by doing Alt + Drag or scroll wheel. On certain Linux distributions,
those shortcuts and gestures may cause conflicts between Surge and the desktop environment. We decided we couldn't
give up alt-drag for all platforms because one window manager in one distribution used it by default. Therefore,
it's often possible to disable that global gesture in desktop environments, and would be the easiest way to solve
that possible issue.

<br/>
<br/>

### Building from source
If you would like to build Surge XT from source, see the instructions on
[our Github repository](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge).

<br/>
<br/>

## Intalling Surge XT alongside Surge 1.9 and earlier
Although Surge XT represents an evolution of Surge, Surge XT is an entirely new plugin. This means that you can
effortlessly install it alongside Surge 1.9 or earlier, and you will need to keep Surge 1.9 installed in order 
to open existing projects containing older versions of Surge.

<br/>

## Locations

### Windows

The preset library and wavetables are at `C:ProgramData\Surge XT`.
The user presets are at `C:\Users\your username\My Documents\Surge XT`

### macOS

The preset library and wavetables are at `/Library/Application Support/Surge XT`.
The user presets are at `~/Documents/Surge XT`.

### Linux

The plugin itself, preset library and wavetables are at `/usr/share/surge-xt` with a standard install.
The user presets are at `~/Documents/Surge XT`, this directory will be created once you store a patch or preset or change the user default settings for the first time.

<br/>

Note: These locations can be changed in Surge's menu (see [Data Folders](#data-folders)).
<br/>
If you put user content in the factory folder or otherwise change it, future installers will erase it. 
Surge XT's installers never touch anything in the user area.

So, if you want to install a custom skin, set of patches, or otherwise add things to Surge, 
put them in your user data folder instead of here, or risk losing them when you upgrade.

<br/>
<br/>


# Introduction to the User Interface

The user-interface of Surge XT is divided into four main sections:
  - Patch/Global
  - Scene controls
  - Modulation/Routing
  - FX

Keeping this structure in mind will make it easier to understand the layout.

![Illustration 1: The four sections the user-interface that Surge XT is divided into.](./images/Pictures/sections.png)

*The four sections of the user-interface that Surge is divided into.*

<br/>

## The "Scene" Concept

Every patch in Surge XT contains two scenes (A & B) and an effect-section.
Both scenes and all effect settings are stored in every patch. A scene is similar to a
traditional synthesizer patch as it stores all the information used to synthesize a voice.
Since there are two scenes in each patch, itâ€™s possible to have layered or split sounds stored within a single patch.
(see [Scene Select and Scene Mode](#scene-select-and-scene-mode)).

![Illustration 2: Both scenes and all effect settings are stored in every patch.](./images/Pictures/illu2.png)

<br/>

## Audio Outputs

When loaded into a DAW, each instance of Surge XT has **3 audio outputs**:
- Stereo Out
- Scene A Out
- Scene B Out

In some hosts, like FL Studio for instance, Surge XT will disable the individual scene outputs due to a conflict with
the DAW's audio routing architecture. To enable those additional outputs in such cases,
see [this option](#workflow) in the Surge XT menu.

<br/>

## Sliders and controls

The most common user-interface control in Surge XT is the slider. They come
in both horizontal and vertical orientations but their functionality is
otherwise identical.

Sliders are always dragged, there is no jump if you click on the slider
tray instead of the slider head, it enters dragging mode nonetheless.

Slider interactions:  
  - **Left-click drag** - Drag slider
  - **Shift + Left-click drag** - Drag slider (fine)
  - **Ctrl/Cmd + Left-click drag** - Drag slider (quantized steps)
  - **Alt + Left-click drag** - Drag slider in elastic mode (snaps back to initial position upon release)
  - **Scroll Wheel** - Move Slider
  - **Shift + Scroll Wheel** - Move slider (fine)
  - **Double left-click** - Reset parameter to default value  
  - **Right-click** - Context menu
  - **Hover** - See the slider's current value without clicking on it

Other than sliders, some of Surge XT's parameters are also displayed as number and value fields, buttons and button rows.

<br/>

### Parameter context menu

Any parameter's context menu can be brought up with a right-click. This menu has numerous useful functions:

![Illustration 5: Slider context menu](./images/Pictures/slider_context_menu.png)

#### Name and contextualized help
Clicking on this first option will open this user manual to the correct section explaining the parameter in question.

#### Edit Value
This option allows you to type in the desired value of a parameter. Once the value popup appears, its text will
already be highlighted, and you can start typing the value right away. When you are done, simply press Enter to
confirm the change. To cancel and close this popup, simply press the Escape key or move any other parameter.

Note that for any value type-in windows in Surge XT, there is no need to type in the unit of the entered value.

![](./images/Pictures/typein_window.png)

For discrete parameters (Unison Voices, or a button row for instance), instead of a type-in field, all the possible
values will be displayed right in the menu so they can be accessed directly.

![](./images/Pictures/discrete_values.png)

#### Extend Range
Some parameters can have their range extended. The option **Extend range** will appear in the context menu
if they do. **Pitch**, for instance, is one of those parameters.

#### Tempo Sync
Some parameters can be synchronized to the host tempo. The option **Tempo sync** will appear in the
context menu if they do.

Once tempo-synced, when using the Surge XT Classic skin, the slider will show a "TS" symbol on their handles to indicate that state, like so:

![](./images/Pictures/ts_slider.png)

This indication can vary depending on the skin used.

#### Enabled
Some parameters can be enabled or disabled. If a slider appears transparent or is missing its handle,
in some cases, it can be because the parameter is disabled. To toggle it, simply click on that option.

#### Modulations
This section of the menu will appear if the right-clicked slider is being modulated by some modulation source(s) (if it has a blue tint). See [Routing](#routing) for more information.

- **Red X icon** - Clicking on this icon to the left of a modulation source will clear that modulation routing.
- **Speaker icon** - Clicking on this will allow you to mute (bypass) a modulation source in the list. Simply click
that icon again to unmute that source.
- **Pencil icon** - This will bring up the modulation amount type-in window.
Simply type-in the desired amount of modulation you want to apply to that parameter. See 
[Edit Value](#edit-value) for more information.

#### Add Modulation From
As its name suggests, this menu entry allows you to directly link a modulator to the right-clicked control.
All the available modulation sources are sorted in different categories so you can find the desired one easier.
Once a modulation source is chosen, a type-in window will appear, allowing you to enter the modulation amount you
want to apply.

#### Assign parameter to...
This option allows to assign the right-clicked parameter to any MIDI CC.

#### MIDI Learn Parameter...
This is where you assign a MIDI controller to the desired slider. To abort MIDI learning on that parameter,
simply right-click again and the option will now become **Abort Parameter MIDI Learn**.

#### Clear learned MIDI (...)
This option will be available if the selected parameter has already been MIDI learned. It allows you to clear that link (the
existing link MIDI CC number will be shown in parentheses).

#### VST3 Options
Finally, the VST3 version of Surge XT supports VST3 context menu items. Depending on the host,
there may be more or less options regarding automation, MIDI, or parameter values.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


# Patch/Global Section
![](./images/Pictures/patchglobal.png)
<br/>
<br/>
## Scene Select and Scene Mode
![](./images/Pictures/scene_select.png)

There are two setups of all controls within the Scene section of the user interface.
The **Scene Select** buttons **[A|B]** determine which one is selected for editing.
Right-clicking on these buttons brings up a context menu that allows you to copy/paste scene content.

Depending on the **Scene Mode**, these two buttons could also be used to choose which scene will be *played*.
Indeed, whether a scene will generate a voice when a key is pressed is determined by the **Scene Mode** setting:

  - **Single** â€“ Notes will be played only by the selected scene.
  - **Key Split** â€“ Notes below the **split key** will be played by scene A,
    notes above and including the **split key** will be played by scene
    B.
  - **Channel Split** Notes from MIDI channels below the **split MIDI channel** will be played by scene A,
    notes from MIDI channels above and including the **split MIDI channel** will be played by scene B.
  - **Dual** â€“ Both scenes will play all the  notes.

In both **Key Split** and **Dual** mode, if MPE is disabled, the system also supports MIDI channel routing where Channel 2 plays only
Scene A and channel 3 plays only Scene B. MIDI channel 1 and all other channels higher than 3 play the Split/Dual mode.

**Poly** shows the number of voices currently playing and allows you to
set an upper limit to the number of voices allowed to play at the same
time by dragging horizontally on the value. The voice-limiter will kill off excess voices gently to avoid
audible artifacts, thus it's not uncommon for the voice count to exceed
the limit.

<br/>

## Patch Browser
![Illustration 3: The patch browser](./images/Pictures/patchbrowser.png)

### Navigating through presets
Cycling through sounds in Surge XT is easy: just press the arrow buttons
until you find something you like. If you left-click the patch-name
field (anywhere in the white area), a menu will list all available
patches arranged into categories. A right-click will bring up a menu with just the
patches of the current category.

These categories are also grouped into three sections depending on who created them:

  - Factory Patches - Patches created in-house by the Surge XT authors.

  - 3<sup>rd</sup> party patches - Patches created by users and 3<sup>rd</sup> parties.
    Categorized by creators.

  - User Patches - Your own patches will be stored here. How you categorize them
    is entirely up to you.

At the bottom, there is an option to [download additional content](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Additional-Content).

You can also directly load patches (.fxp) by dragging and dropping them anywhere over the Surge XT interface.

There is also an option in the patch menu to set the current patch as the default one to be loaded when
opening a new instance of Surge XT.

Finally, the patch menu allows you to rename or delete a patch. Those options will only appear if you have a
non-factory patch loaded in the synth.

<br/>

### Finding Presets
To find presets by patch name, simply click on the magnifier glass icon to the left of the preset name area.
You may see Surge XT first update the preset database before being able to type in your search query.

You can also search for presets by **author** or **category** by typing "AUTHOR=" or "CATEGORY=", followed by
your search query.

### The Save Dialog

![](./images/Pictures/store_dialog.png)

Clicking the **Save** button of the patch browser opens the save dialog.
This is where you name your new patch and choose which category it
should belong in. You can also create a new category manually here as
well. The patches you save will end up in the user section at the bottom
of the patch menu. The save dialog also provides text fields for the name of the patch creator
and comments.

Note: You can display the comments of a particular patch by hovering over the patch name area with your mouse.

### Favoriting patches
Adding a patch to your favorites list is as easy as pressing the heart icon to the right of the patch name area.
Right-clicking on that same icon will allow you to access the favorite patches list.

<br/>



## Status Area

![](./images/Pictures/status.png)

This area is meant to be a quick access to some of Surge XT's features that are also present in the Menu.
(see [Menu Button](#menu-button))

Right-clicking on one of these buttons will reveal more options which are also present in sub-menus under the Menu button as well.

For instance, the first time you press the **Tune** button if no custom tuning is loaded, it will open the same menu
as if you would have right-clicked on that button. Once a custom tuning is loaded however, left-clicking on it will
turn the loaded tuning on or off. See [Microtonal Tuning](#microtonal-tuning) for more information.

Alternatively, **.scl** and **.kbm** files can also be dragged and dropped anywhere on the interface to import
custom tuning. //FIXME

<br/>

## FX-Bypass, Character and Global Volume

![](./images/Pictures/fx_bypass.png)

**FX Bypass** lets you quickly hear what a patch sounds like without the effect-units. (see [FX Section](#fx-section))

  - **Off** â€“ Bypass is disabled, all effects are active.
  - **Send** â€“ The send effects are bypassed.
  - **Send + Global** - The send and global effects are bypassed.
  - **All** â€“ All effects are bypassed.



**Character** controls the amount of high-frequency content present in
most of Surge XT's oscillator algorithms. Available choices are Warm, Neutral
and Bright.

**Global Volume** controls the last gain stage before the output. The
VU meter above it shows the output level and will become red if it goes
above 0 dBFS. You can choose to hard clip the global output either at
**+18 dBFS** (default) or **0 dBFS**.

The state of these two settings are **not** stored with patches. They
are however stored by the host application in your project files.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Scene Controls Section

The UI of the scene section can also be further divided into two parts:

  - Sound generation
  - Sound shaping

The sound is generated and mixed in the sound generation section. After that, it
goes through the sound shaping section.

![](./images/Pictures/illu9_3.png)

<br/>

## Sound Generation

This is where the sound is born. The oscillators generate waveforms
according to the notes played. They are then summed up in the mixer.

<br/>

![](./images/Pictures/sound_generation.png)

### Oscillators

**1/2/3-buttons** â€“ Chooses the active oscillator for editing. You can right-click on one of them
and a context menu with the name, **Copy** and **Copy (with modulation)** options will show up.

**Display** â€“ Shows the active waveform. When the **Wavetable** or **Window** oscillator
is used, it will also work as wavetable selector by clicking on the orange bar or on the arrows
to cycle through them.

**Type** â€“ Oscillator type. Chooses which algorithm is used for the
oscillator. Available options are:
- Classic
- Modern
- Wavetable
- Window
- Sine
- FM2
- FM3
- String
- Twist
- Alias
- S&H Noise
- Audio Input.


See [Oscillator algorithms](#oscillator-algorithms) in the Technical Reference section for more information.

**Pitch & Octave** â€“ Controls the pitch for this particular oscillator.
Its context menu can be used to extend its range, or to set the pitch to **Absolute** mode, which makes the pitch shift
in absolute frequency as opposed to relative to the note that is being played.

**Keytrack** â€“ When disabled, the oscillator will play the same pitch
regardless of the key pressed. This button can be right-clicked to toggle its state across all
oscillators in the scene.

**Retrigger** â€“ If active, the oscillator and all its unison voices will always start immediately
at the same phase position. This is useful for snappy sounds where you want the
attack to sound exactly the same each note. This button can be right-clicked to set its state across all
oscillators in the scene.

**Other** - The rest of the sliders from the oscillator editor are specific to each
oscillator type. See [Oscillator algorithms](#oscillator-algorithms) in the
Technical Reference section for more information.

<br/>

### Mixer

#### Mixer Channels

Excluding the **Pre-filter Gain** (slider on the right), the Mixer has 6 channels (sources) from left to right:

  - **Oscillators 1, 2, 3**

  - **Ring Modulation of 1x2, 2x3** â€“ The source of these two channels is **digital ring modulation** from the oscillators.
                                      This type of RM is a bit different from the traditional carrier-modulator style ring modulation.
                                      Digital ring modulation is simply the result of multiplying the output of oscillators 1 and 2,
                                      or 2 and 3.
  - **Noise Oscillator**

#### Channel Parameters

Each channel has the following controls:

  - **M** â€“ Mute. You can of course have multiple channels muted at the same time, but you can also keep only the channel
  you mute muted by holding down **Ctrl / Cmd** and clicking on the desired mute switch.

  - **S** â€“ Solo (only play channels that have solo active). You can have multiple channels in solo at the same time, or
  only one at a time by holding down **Ctrl / Cmd** and clicking on the desired solo switch.

  - **Triple Orange Box** (Filter routing) â€“ Chooses which filter the channel is routed to.
                The left position routes the channel output to filter 1, the right position
                routes it to filter 2, while the middle position, which is selected
                by default, routes it to both.
                However, this setting will only route the channel output to filter
                1 if a **serial** filter block configuration is used, since the
                audio will then go through the second one in the filter block anyways.
                If any other configuration than serial is used, the audio will then
                be routed to both filters, as expected.

  - **Slider** â€“ Gain control for each input.

<br/>

### Other sound generation parameters

**Pitch & Octave** â€“ Controls the pitch for the entire scene. Affects
the filter key-tracking and the keytrack modulation source as well. The
range of the slider can be extended using the context menu.

**Portamento** â€“ Portamento is when a new note will slide in
pitch from the pitch of the last played note. This setting determines how
long the slide will be. A setting of 0 disables Portamento. This parameter can be
tempo-synced.

Portamento has some interesting options accessible in its context menu:
- **Constant rate** - If this option is enabled, the time to cover **one octave** is
defined by the Portamento slider value. From there on, gliding between 2 octaves
for instance will take twice as long, and so on.
By default, this option is disabled, so the **glide rate**
is proportional to the distance between the two keys, making it so that it
always takes the same time to glide between **any two keys**.
- **Glissando** - If this option is enabled, the pitch slide will be quantized
to the scale degrees.
- **Retrigger at scale degrees** - If this option is enabled, the FEG and AEG
(see [Envelope Generators](#envelope-generators)) will be triggered each time the portamento
slide crosses a scale degree.
- **Curve options** - You can choose between a **Logarithmic**, **Linear** or **Exponential**
portamento curve. By default, the portamento slide follows a linear curve.

**Osc Drift** â€“ Applies a small amount of instability to the pitch of
all oscillators, making them subtly detuned. Although the parameter is
shared, the randomness of the instability effect is independent for all
oscillators and all the unison voices of each oscillator. By right-clicking
on this control, you can choose to also randomize the pitch at the very start of
the note by enabling the **Randomize initial drift phase** option.

**Noise Color** â€“ Affects the frequency spectrum of the noise
generator. The middle position results in white noise. Moving the slider
to the left emphasizes low frequencies while moving it to the right emphasizes high frequencies.

**Bend Depth** â€“ Pitch Bend Depth Up/Down. Controls the range of the
pitch bend wheel, in semitones.

This control can be extended with the dedicated option in its context menu. It enables
type-ins of fractions and cents for configuring microtonal pitch-bends of arbitrary size within the range
of 24 semitones.

**Play Mode** â€“ Chooses how multiple notes are handled. Poly will allow
multiple notes to be played simultaneously, while Mono will only let the last note
play. Latch will continuously play the last played note (mono).

Mono has two possible modifiers:

  - **Single Trigger EG (ST)** means that the two envelope generators are
    not restarted when sliding between two notes (two notes that overlap
    in time)
  - **Fingered Portamento (FP)** means that portamento is only applied when
    sliding between notes and not when there is time between the played
    notes.

When **Play Mode** is set to one of the Mono modes, the context menu of that button list will display
additional options related to mono note priority:

- **Last note priority** - Will play the latest note when multiple notes are played together
- **High note priority** - Will play the highest note when multiple notes are played together
- **Low note priority** - Will play the lowest note when multiple notes are played together
- **Legacy note priority** - When multiple notes are played together, it will play the latest note once hit and play
the highest remaining note once released.

- **Sustain pedal in mono mode**
  - **Sustain pedal holds all notes (no note off retrigger)** - If sustain is engaged and multiple notes are hit then
  held one after the other, Surge XT will stay on the latest note when releasing that note instead of switching to the previous
  note.
  - **Sustain pedal allows note off retrigger** - If sustain is engaged and multiple notes are hit then held one after
  the other, Surge XT will switch to the previous note when the latest note is released.

<br/>
<br/>

## Sound shaping

<br/>

![](./images/Pictures/sound_shaping.png)

### Filter controls
**Filter Block Configuration** â€“ Chooses how the filters, waveshaper and
the gain stage are connected together. Note that only the Stereo and Wide configurations
will output a stereo signal.

**Feedback** â€“ Controls the amount (and polarity) of output that's fed
back into the input of the filter block. It has no effect when using the
Serial 1 filter block configuration (which because of this has a lower
CPU load).

Note:
Be careful with your monitoring volume when using feedback. It's easy to
make really loud high-pitched noises by mistake if you're not familiar
with how the synth reacts to feedback.  

Don't let this scare you though. There's a lot to be gained from proper
and creative use of feedback. Changing the character of filters, making
filters interact together, making basic physical models, making sounds
that are just about to break apart. It is these things that make
Surge XT truly special.

**Filter Balance** â€“ Controls how the two filters are mixed. The
behavior depends on the filter block configuration.

**Type** â€“ Selects the type of the filter. There are [numerous types available](#filter-algorithms).
You can disable the filter in question here by unchecking the **Enabled** option below the different
filter type categories.

**Subtype** â€“ Selects variations of each filter type. The difference can
vary from subtle to radical depending on how the filter is used. See
[Filter algorithms](#filter-algorithms) in the Technical Reference section
for information regarding subtypes of each filter type. It is displayed
as a number next to the filter type (when available).

**Cutoff** â€“ Controls the cutoff frequency of the filter. When tweaked, while its tooltip
will show frequency in Hz, it will also show its approximate MIDI note value,
very useful when using the filter for melodic and tuning purposes.
You can also right-click on this control and choose the option
**Reset cutoff to keytrack root** which makes it very easy to tune filters
when using filter keytracking. Finally, the **Apply SCL/KBM tuning to filter cutoff**
option can be accessed when the **Apply tuning after modulation** option is enabled in the Tuning menu.
See [this section](#apply-tuning-at-midi-input--after-modulation-menu-options) in the
technical reference for more information.

**Resonance** â€“ Controls the amount of resonance of the filter.

**Filter 2 Offset Button** (small "+" button to the right of the filter parameters) â€“ When active,
the cutoff frequency will be set relative to filter 1.
This includes any modulations (including the hardwired FEG depth &
keytracking). Filter 2's cutoff frequency slider **becomes an offset** setting relative
to filter 1's cutoff frequency.

**Resonance Link Button** (small button, filter 2 only) â€“ Makes the slider
follow filter 1's resonance slider setting.

**Keytrack \> F1/F2** â€“ Controls how much the pitch of a note affects the
cutoff frequency of the filter. A setting of 100% means the filter
frequency will follow the pitch harmonically.

<br/>

### Envelope Generators

There are two envelope generators connected to the filter block.

![](./images/Pictures/EGs.png)

On the left is the Filter Envelope Generator (Filter EG).
It is hardwired to the two filters, whose depth is set by the **\>F1** and **\>F2** sliders.

On the right is the Amplitude Envelope Generator (Amp EG). This one is hardwired to the gain
stage of the filter block.

<br/>

![Illustration 10: ADSR envelope structure](./images/Pictures/illu10.png)

*The ADSR envelope structure*

The envelope generators are of the 4-stage ADSR type. This is the most
common form of EG used in synthesizers and it is named after its four
stages **Attack**, **Decay**, **Sustain** and **Release**. If you're new
to synthesizer programming the illustration should give you a good idea
how they work. The thing you need to remember is that after going
through the attack & decay stages the envelope will stick in the sustain
stage until the key is released.

**Attack**, **Decay** and **Release** are time-based parameters and can be tempo-synced by right-clicking on one of
those sliders. You will also find an option to tempo-sync those three controls at once for each envelope generator.

Above the envelope stage controls is a graphic representation of the
ADSR structure.

If the envelope mode is set to **Digital**, there will be small adjustable orange fields
on the graphic. Dragging them horizontally allows you to choose the curvature of the different stages of the envelope.

![](./images/Pictures/EGs_orange_fields.png)

If the envelope mode is set to **Analog**, the curvature of the different stages
will automatically be set to a shape that tries to emulate analog behavior.

<br/>

### Waveshaper

The waveshaper module now features 43 waveforms and is an integral part of Surge's audio path.

![](./images/Pictures/waveshaper.png)

**Waveshaper selector** - Menu allowing you to change the type of the non-linear wave-shaping.
Alternatively, you can also use the arrow buttons, left-click and drag, or scroll with the mouse wheel
over the waveshaper display to cycle through the different shapes.

**Waveshaper drive** â€“ The vertical slider to the right of the waveshaper display. Sets the drive amount 
of the waveshaper. This control can be extended.

**Waveshaper Analysis window** - This panel can be opened by clicking on the small icon at the
bottom of the waveshaper module. It allows you to visually preview the output of the waveshaper
at different input levels, which can be controlled with the **Drive** vertical preview slider.

![](./images/Pictures/waveshaper_analysis.png)

<br/>

### Other sound shaping parameters

**Keytrack root note** â€“ Sets the root key of the filter keytracking and the
keytrack modulation source. At the root key, the keytrack modulation
source will have the value zero. Above/below it it will have
positive/negative modulation depending on the distance to the root key
in octaves. This parameter does not affect the oscillator pitch.

**Keytrack amount sliders** - Sets the amount of filter keytracking applied to
each filter.

**HP** â€“ Controls the scene high-pass filter (scene parameter). This parameter can be disabled, which will remove it
from the audio path.

**FM configuration** â€“ Chooses how oscillator FM (frequency modulation) is
routed.

**FM depth** â€“ Sets the depth of the oscillator FM.

**Amp Vel.** - Controls how the **Amp Gain** scales with velocity. This
is neutral at the maximum position. Other settings provide attenuation
at lower velocities, thus this setting will never increase the **Amp
Gain** parameter by velocity.

**Amp Gain** â€“ Controls the gain element inside the filter block.

<br/>

### Scene output

The output stage is located after the filter block in the audio-path. As
it's outside the filter block-structure changing the gain here doesn't
have any affect on the timbre of the voice (unlike the previous
gain-control which may affect how the feedback and wave-shaping acts),
but it can still change the timbre of the effect section if non-linear
effects (like distortion) are used.

**Volume** â€“ Scene volume control. You can choose to hard clip the scene output at **+18 dBFS** (default),
**0 dBFS** , or to **disable hard clipping** by right-clicking this control and choosing the desired option.

**Pan** â€“ Pan/balance control

**Width** â€“ The amount of stereo spread (only present for the **Stereo** and
**Wide** filter block configurations)

**Send FX 1/2 or 3/4 Level** â€“ Send levels to send slot 1 to 4 (scene parameters). 
To display send 3/4 levels, simply select one of those send FX units in the unit selector
(see [Effect Unit Selector](#effect-unit-selector)).

# Modulation/Routing Section

The modulation section is different from the sound generation
and shaping sections as no audio data is passed through it. Instead it
allows you to control the parameters in the other sections from various
sources.

![](./images/Pictures/modulation_routing.png)

<br/>

## Routing

Modulation routing in Surge XT is a bit different compared to most synthesizers,
but it's actually very intuitive and extremely powerful, thanks to the routing bar.

![](./images/Pictures/routingbar.png)

<br/>

### How to apply modulation to parameters
Here's how it works:

1. Select the modulation source you want to use.

    ![](./images/Pictures/routing_1.png)

2. Engage routing mode with a second click on the source. It will become bright green,
and sliders that can be modulated will display a blue modulation depth slider on top of their normal sliders.

    ![](./images/Pictures/routing_2.png)

3. Drag the desired modulation slider (blue slider) to the position you want the parameter to be at
when fully modulated (at the top peak of a Sine LFO, or after the attack stage of an envelope for example).
The modulation's full range will then be shown with the corresponding green bar on the slider.

    ![](./images/Pictures/routing_3.png)

4. Disengage routing mode by clicking again on the modulation source.

    ![](./images/Pictures/routing_1.png)

<br/>
Alternatively, routing mode can also be engaged or disengaged by pressing the **middle** mouse buttons anywhere over
the interface, or by pressing **TAB** on the keyboard if this option is enabled (see [Workflow section](#workflow)
in the menu).


You can also directly access the numerical modulation amount dialog (explained [here](#edit-value))
by dragging the desired modulation source over a modulatable parameter.

Note that modulation range is always **relative** to the base value represented by the gray slider,
meaning that moving its position will then shift the whole modulation range up or down.
This also means that if a modulation slider's value is smaller than the base value,
the modulation polarity will be inverted.

Also, when applying modulation to certain time-based parameters (such as Portamento, envelope attack, etc.) that are
set to 0.00 seconds, in some cases, the modulation won't trigger properly due to the way it works internally.
To fix this, simply increase the parameter in question by a very small amount, just so it doesn't have a value
of 0.

<br/>

### Modulating LFO parameters with another modulator

When clicking on one of the LFO buttons in the routing bar, both the LFO source
selection and the LFO editor will be selected. However, the two actions can be separated, as you can choose which button is selected as the modulation routing source, and at the same time edit parameters from **a different
LFO** than the source.

To do that, select the source normally, and then click
on the mini-button on another LFO (the small orange arrow):

![](./images/Pictures/modulationsourceselectionbar.png)

This effectively lets you **modulate the parameters of one LFO with any other mod source(s)**.
However, as an example, note that logistically, an S-LFO can modulate parameters of an LFO, but
an LFO **cannot** modulate parameters of an S-LFO
(see [Voice modulators vs. Scene modulators](#voice-modulators-vs-scene-modulators)).

Remember that you can also see which LFO is currently being displayed in the editor by looking at what's written
vertically to the left of the editor.

<br/>

### Modulated sliders

Once a slider is routed to a modulation source, the shade of blue on its tray indicates
whether the parameter is modulated and by which source.

![](./images/Pictures/illu7.png)

1) Parameter is not modulated (gray)

2) Parameter is modulated (gray-blue)

3) Parameter is modulated by the currently selected modulation source (bright-blue)

Moreover, if you hover your mouse pointer over any modulated slider, the source(s) it's being modulated
from will be highlighted in the routing bar. This makes it easier to see what modulation source(s) are
linked to a parameter.

<br/>

### Modulation source selectors
Once routed to any parameter, the modulation source selectors change their appearance depending if they are selected,
and if they are routed in the current patch or not. (scene dependent)

![](./images/Pictures/mod_source_buttons.png)

1) Unused modulation source

2) Used modulation source

3) Unused selected modulation source

4) Used selected modulation source

<br/>
Some modulation source selectors in the routing bar have a hamburger menu. This serves as an indicator that
different types of that modulation source are available. You can access them directly by clicking on that
hamburger menu, by right-clicking and going into the **Switch to...** submenu, or simply by scrolling with
the mouse wheel over the modulation source selector in question.

![](./images/Pictures/hamburger_menu_modsource.png)

<br/>

### Clearing modulation

After right-clicking on a modulated slider, you will see an option to easily clear the modulation and un-link it from its source.

![](./images/Pictures/clear_modulation.png)

Alternatively, you can also reset its modulation slider (blue slider) to 0 by double-clicking on it
when routing mode is engaged, or entering 0 in the type-in editor (see [Edit Value](#edit-value)).

<br/>

Furthermore, by right-clicking on any modulation source, there will be options to clear a particular linked parameter,
but also all of them at once.

![](./images/Pictures/modsource_context_menu.png)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Modulation list
Surge XT has a detailed modulation list that can be displayed by clicking on the vertical rectangular button at the left of the routing bar:

![](./images/Pictures/modlist.png)

This pannel will display the modulation routings and their amounts from both scenes in the current patch.
Different display options are available to the left of its interface:

**Sort by** - Allows you to choose whether the list of modulations is grouped according to the source they are
coming from or to the target they are routed to.

**Filter By...** - This option allows you to only display certain modulation routings by hiding those that
aren't included in the desired source or target in this list.

**Add Modulation** - These two menus allow you to directly add a new modulation routing directly from the
modulation list pannel. Simply select a modulation source and a modulation target to link a modulator to a
parameter.

**Value Display** - Allows you to choose between 4 different display options regarding the modulation values
displayed in the sliders section, ranging from **None** to **Values, Depths and Ranges**.

Finally, in the sliders section, you can both adjust the different modulation amounts, but also direcltly
**mute** or **remove** a modulation routing entirely.


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


## Modulators
Surge XT has four main types of modulation sources :

 - LFOs
 - Internal modulators
 - Voice and note properties
 - Macros


All of these modulation sources are located in the routing bar (see [Routing](#routing)) :

![](./images/Pictures/routingbar.png)

<br/>

![](./images/Pictures/routingbar_sections.png)

*The four types of modulation sources, separated in categories.*

<br/>

### Voice modulators vs. Scene modulators

Some modulation sources operate at the voice level, while others operate at the scene level.
Although they might seem similar, there is an important factor that distinguishes them.

One one hand, a voice modulator has separate modulation paths *for each voice*, meaning it can
control voice-level parameters (like filter cutoff) but cannot control scene level parameters (like FX levels or scene pitch).

On the other hand, a scene modulator has one identical modulation path *for the whole scene*, so it can control both scene level parameters **and** voice level parameters.

<br/>
![](./images/Pictures/modsource_labels.png)

*On top, three voice LFOs. On the bottom, three Scene LFOs, "S-" meaning Scene.*

<br/>
To demonstrate this distinction, let's say an sine wave LFO is modulating the cutoff of a filter.
Now, if 3 notes are being hit with a small delay between each of them, the phase of the LFO will be delayed between the notes accordingly.

You will indeed clearly hear the cutoff of the filter moving independently for each note, which gives the impression that there are three LFOs and three filters (which there actually is!).
The same principle applies for envelopes.

<br/>

However, unlike the first demonstration, this time, if an S-LFO is modulating a certain parameter,
hitting more notes will not "add" an LFO for each voice, which gives the impression that there is a single LFO
modulating the cutoff frequency of the filter instead of many.


See [Modulation routing in-depth](#modulation-routing-in-depth) in the Technical Reference section for more information.
<br/>
<br/>


### LFOs

Compared to some other synthesizers, Surge XT does not have dedicated **LFO**, **Envelope**, **Step sequencer** or
**MSEG** modulation sources. Instead, those are integrated within every LFO. This effectively enables the
flexibility of having up to 12 LFOs, envelopes, step sequencers or MSEGs, and everything in between simply by
changing their shape.

Surge XT's LFOs are very flexible and come with a built in DAHDSR-envelope which can
either work as a dedicated envelope generator or shape the amplitude of other modulation types over time.

![](./images/Pictures/lfo_editor.png)

<br/>

Surge XT has a total of 12 LFOs:
 - 6 Voice LFO sources (labeled LFO 1-6 for instance)
 - 6 Scene LFO sources (labeled S-LFO 1-6 for instance)

See [Voice modulators vs. Scene modulators](#voice-modulators-vs-scene-modulators) for an explanation about the difference LFOs and S-LFOs.

<br/>

*On the left, the different shapes and their explanation. On the right, the way that the* ***Deform*** *parameter affects the waveform.*

Depending on the selected shape for a particular LFO, its name in the routing bar will change.
When using the first 6 waveforms, it will be called **LFO**. However, when using the envelope shape, **ENV**
will be displayed, **SEQ** will be displayed when the step-sequencer is used, and for the MSEG, **MSEG**
will be displayed. Scene LFOs have their equivalent labels as well:

![](./images/Pictures/modsource_labels.png)

<br/>

#### Parameters
<br/>
![](./images/Pictures/lfo_editor.png)

**Rate** â€“ Controls the modulation rate. When the type is set to
Step Seq, one step equals the whole cycle. This slider can be tempo-synced
and disabled from its context menu.
Deactivating the rate effectively freezes the LFO to a certain constant value depending on the
Phase/Shuffle parameter.
This can be useful for manually scrubbing in a waveform cycle of an LFO for instance, and can also be used in
the same way in the sequencer. This feature can also be used to make the modulation source act as a
**randomizer** in tandem with the "Random" trigger mode. A simpler [Random](#random-modulation-source)
modulation source can however also be used for that purpose.
Furthermore, modulation can even be applied to the Phase/Shuffle parameter with another modulation source
which opens up a lot of possibilities, such as effectively using the frozen LFO as a mod mapper.

Note: In the LFO editor, when right-clicking parameters that can be tempo-synced, there will also be an option to Tempo sync all the LFO parameters at once.

**Phase/Shuffle** - Controls the starting phase of the modulation waveform. As with any parameter,
it can be modulated. However, in this case, its modulated value will not change after the modulation is triggered
(for instance, it's not possible to shift an LFO's phase while a note is pressed).
Only starting phase is taken into account. This control can also be extended, allowing for bipolar shuffle,
useful for adding swing in the step sequencer.

**Amplitude** â€“ Controls the amplitude of the modulation. This is the parameter
you should use if you want to control the depth of an LFO with a
controller (like controlling vibrato depth with the modulation wheel, for instance). This control can also be
extended form its context menu, which allows you to reach a negative amplitude range (-100 to 100% instead of 0 to 100%).

**Deform** â€“ Deform the modulation shape in various ways. The effect varies depending on the selected shape.
Different deform types are available for the **Sine**, **Triangle**, **Sawtooth**, **S&H** and **Envelope**
shapes, and can be accessed by right-clicking on the **Deform** slider.


**Trigger mode** â€“ Chooses how the LFO is triggered when a new note is played:

- **Freerun** â€“ The LFO's starting phase is synchronized with the host's song position to make it continuously running in the background. The modulation will be trigged at its starting phase when playback position is either at the beginning position and the song starts playing, or when playback position goes back at the beginning of a loop
for instance. Freerun behaves the same on voice LFOs or scene LFOs.
- **Keytrigger** â€“ The LFO's starting phase is triggered when a new note is pressed.
If the synth is set to "Poly", each new voice gets its own LFO triggered with it when using a voice LFO.
However, when using an scene LFO, the first voice sets the LFO's position, then the other ones will follow it.
- **Random** â€“ The LFO's starting phase is set to a random point in its cycle. If the synth is set to "Poly",
each new voice gets its own LFO triggered with it when using an voice LFO.
However, when using an scene LFO, the first voice sets the LFO's position, then the other ones will follow it.


**Unipolar** - If active, the modulation will be in the \[0 .. 1\]
range (unipolar). If not, it will be in the \[-1 .. 1\] range (bipolar).

The modulation range on a parameter is represented by a green bar when routing
mode is engaged (see [Routing](#routing)).

*Modulation on a control from a bipolar source*

<br/>

![](./images/Pictures/routing_3_unipolar.png)

*Modulation on a control from a unipolar source*

<br/>
<br/>


#### LFO Envelope Generator

The Envelope Generators are of the 6-stage DAHDSR type that are
multiplied with the waveform generator, no matter what the selected LFO shape is.
This means that if the LFO shape is set to Envelope, the output will simply be 100%,
and can then be shaped by the LFO EG.

Also, note that when using the Envelope shape, the envelope will always trigger on key trigger,
no matter what the trigger mode is set to.

The LFO envelope generator can be completely disabled by right-clicking on one of its controls and unchecking
the **Enabled** option.

![](./images/Pictures/lfo_eg.png)

![Illustration 12: 6-stage DAHDSR envelope](./images/Pictures/illu12.png)

*6-stage DAHDSR envelope*

<br/>

#### Step Sequencer

The **Step Seq** shape houses a step sequencing editor where the LFO display would be. It allows you to draw
the output waveform with up to 16 steps.

![Illustration 13: Step Seq editor](./images/Pictures/stepseq.png)

*Step Sequencer editor*

The two blue markers define loop-points in which the
sequence will repeat once it gets into the loop. The left mouse button is
used for drawing while the right one can be used to clear the values to
zero.

To quickly reset a step to 0, either double-click on a step, or hold down Ctrl/Cmd and click or drag with the mouse over
the desired step(s).

Right-clicking and dragging over steps allows you to draw a straight line over the desired steps,
thus creating a perfectly linear staircase pattern.

Holding down **Shift** while drawing will quantize the values to
the scale degrees (1/12<sup>th</sup> in case of standard tuning, or possibly other
for custom tuning) spanning the range of **one octave**.
Furthermore, holding down **Shift + Alt** makes two times more values available, hence
useful when modulating pitch by **two octaves** instead.

For more information on microtonal pitch modulation using the step sequencer, you can read
[this article](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Microtonal-pitch-modulation-using-the-step-sequencer)
on Surge's wiki.


<br/>

The step sequencers inside **voice LFOs** have an extra lane at the top of the
step editor allowing to re-trigger the two regular voice envelopes
(The Amplitude and Filter Envelope Generators) when the small
rectangle is filled at that particular step.

![Illustration 14: Envelope retrigger pane of LFO 1](./images/Pictures/illu14.png)

*Step Seq of LFO 1 containing the re-trigger pane*

However, shift-clicking or right-clicking those rectangles allows the specified step in the sequencer to **only
trigger one of the two envelopes**. When the step is half-filled on the left,
only the filter envelope will be triggered. When filled on the right, only the amplitude envelope will be triggered.

![](./images/Pictures/triggerlanes.png)

<br/>

The **Deform** parameter gives the **Step Seq** waveform a lot of flexibility. A value of
0% will output the steps just as they look on the editor. Negative
values will give an increasingly spiky waveform while positive values
will make the output smoother.

|**Negative deform**| ![](./images/Pictures/stepseq_deform1.png)|
|**Positive deform**| ![](./images/Pictures/stepseq_deform2.png)|


![Illustration 15: Effect of the deform parameter on the step Seq waveform](./images/Pictures/illu15.png)

*Effect of the deform parameter on the step Seq waveform*

<br/>
<br/>

#### Multi-Segment Envelope Generator (MSEG)

Surge XT's Multi-Segment Envelope Generator (MSEG) is powerful and fully editable with a large number of curve types
and various editing options. It can be used to create more complicated LFO waveforms or envelopes
compared to the previously mentioned modulation shapes.
With the combination of various settings in the editing window and the usual parameters from the LFO editor,
you can practically create any modulation shape you could think of.

![](./images/Pictures/mseg.png)

To open this MSEG editing window, you can either click on the little pencil button next to the wave display (1),
click on the wave display itself (2), or double-click on the MSEG icon in the modulation type selector (3):

![](./images/Pictures/open_mseg.png)

<br/>

**Default MSEG state**

Once opened, you will see a shape working as an envelope if you're using a voice LFO, or a triangle wave
working as an LFO if you're using a scene LFO. In any case, you can either build upon these
shapes if they suit your needs, or you can reset them to a simple straight line by right-clicking anywhere
in the edit window, then choosing **Create -> Minimal MSEG**. More information on those menu entries can be
found below.

![](./images/Pictures/default_mseg.png)

<br/>

**Zooming and panning**

In the MSEG editor, you can pan the view left or right by either left-clicking or middle-clicking,
then drag on the background left or right.

You can also zoom in and out by either scrolling with the mouse wheel or left-clicking
then dragging your mouse up or down. Alternatively, you can again middle-click and drag if you prefer.

<br/>

**Moving nodes**

To move a node, simply left-click and drag it. To do the same with multiple nodes at the same time, you can
Shift+left-click and drag, which makes a selection.

<br/>

**Adding and removing nodes**

In Surge XT's MSEG, a segment is comprised of its starting node (point) and the segment itself. A "segment's end node"
is actually the next segment's starting node. To add a new node, simply double-click where you want it to
be added. To remove a node and its following segment, simply double-click on the node you want to remove.
Note that you can only remove nodes if there are more than two nodes remaining in the shape.

<br/>

**Control points**

In addition, you will also often find a **control point** in the middle of a segment. This one can be dragged
vertically (and also sometimes horizontally) to alter the segment's curvature or other properties depending
on the line type. To reset a control point to its default position, simply double-click on it.

<br/>

**MSEG editing and behavior options**

At the bottom of the editor are a couple of options to configure editing modes and general behavior of the MSEG:

- **Movement Mode** - Sets the behavior when moving nodes.
  - **Single** - When dragging a node horizontally, moves a single node without affecting the others.
  - **Shift** - When dragging a node horizontally, shifts around the nodes following the node being moved, keeping the length of the segment belonging to that node constant.
  - **Draw** - Locks horizontal dragging of nodes, allowing you to draw over existing nodes to set their value in a
  simple sweeping motion.

- **Edit Mode** - Configures the MSEG editor to work in Envelope or LFO mode.
  - **Envelope** - Displays draggable loop points and region (effectively representing the Sustain stage in an envelope).
  - **LFO** - Hides the draggable loop points and region, links the value of the start and end nodes to complete the
  waveform cycle, always keep loop mode enabled (even if set to off).

- **Loop Mode**
  - **Off** - Don't loop when in Envelope mode, turn off draggable loop points.
  - **On** - Loop forever in the loop region (between the loop points). Subsequent segments, if any,
  will never be reached.
  - **Gate** - Loop until the note is released, then immediately transition to the segments following the loop region.

- **Snap To Grid**
  - **Horizontal** - Enables horizontal snapping to the grid. The number field to the right corresponds to the
  horizontal grid resolution. You can also temporarily enable horizontal snapping by holding down the Ctrl/Cmd key
  while dragging.
  - **Vertical** - Enables vertical snapping to the grid. The number field to the right corresponds to the
  vertical grid resolution. You can also temporarily enable vertical snapping by holding down the Alt key
  while dragging.

<br/>

**Segment options**

Each segment has options in a context menu which can be accessed with a right-click in the
area of that segment. Some of them are only applied to the right-clicked segment, while others are applied
to the whole shape:

- **Actions**
  - **Split** - Splits the segment into two by adding a new node in its center
  - **Delete** - Remove the segment and its starting node
  - **Double duration** - Doubles the total duration of the whole shape
  - **Half duration** - Halfs the total duration of the whole shape
  - **Flip vertically** - Flips the whole shape vertically
  - **Flip horizontally** - Flips the whole shape horizontally
  - **Quantize notes to snap division** - Quantizes the nodes in the whole shape to the nearest horizontal grid position. Available in Envelope edit mode only.
  - **Quantize notes to whole units** - Quantizes the nodes in the whole shape horizontally to the nearest whole time units. Available in Envelope edit mode only.
  - **Distribute nodes evenly** - Distributes the existing nodes from the whole shape evenly in the horizontal axis between the first and last node.

- **Create**
  - **Minimal MSEG** - Loads a straight line going from 1 to 0 in value, a great starting point to build upon.
  - **Default voice MSEG** - Loads the default voice MSEG preset (envelope shape).
  - **Default scene MSEG** - Loads the default scene MSEG preset (triangle wave LFO shape).
  - **8 to 128 step sequencer** - Replaces the existing shape by an 8 to 128-step sequencer shape.
  - **8 to 128 sawtooth plucks** - Replaces the existing shape by an 8 to 128 sawtooth plucks shape.
  - **8 to 128 lines sine** - Replaces the existing shape by a sine wave made out of 8 to 128 segments.

- **Trigger**
  - **Fiter EG** - Triggers the hardwired filter envelope generator at that point.
  - **Amp EG** - Triggers the hardwired amplifier envelope generator at that point.
  - **Nothing** - Disables the triggering of both the filter and amplifier envelope generators at that point.
  - **All** - Enables the triggering of both the filter and amplifier envelope generators at that point.

- **Settings**
  - **Link start and end nodes** - Links the value of the start and end nodes (useful for seamless
  looping for example).
  - **Deform applied to segment** - Sets if the selected segment is affected by the
   Deform parameter found in the LFO editor or not (see [deform parameter](#parameters)).
  - **Invert deform value** - Inverts the deform polarity applied to the selected segment.

- **Segment types** - List of line types from which a segment can be. The control point, if present,
  will have a different effect depending on the type used.
  - **Hold** - Holds the value of the previous node up to the segment's end node. No control point available.
  - **Linear** - Single line. The control point controls the curvature of the segment.
  - **Bezier** - Single line. The control point can freely bend the segment.
  - **S-curve** - Curved line. The control point determines how abrupt the S-shape is and its direction.
  - **Bump** - Single line. The control point can be moved up or down to create a "bump" in the segment.
  - **Sine, sawtooth, triangle, square** - Sine, sawtooth, triangle or square waves.
  The control point determines how many wave cycles there are between the segment's beginning and end node.
  - **Stairs, smooth stairs** - Stair or smooth stairs line types. The control point determines
  how many steps there are between the segment's beginning and end node.
  - **Brownian bridge** - Random between the beginning and end node every time it's being triggered.
  Moving the control point down adjusts the number of steps while quantizing them up to 24 equidistant steps
  (useful for random scales, for instance). Moving the control point up also adjusts the number of steps, but
  this time without any quantization. The horizontal value of the control point adjusts correlation.

#### Formula

The Formula modulator shape is a fully-fledged and LUA-enabled scriptable modulation source. Although this
shape may not be as straight forward to use and to understand as the others listed above, in its complexity
hides true modulation power, which technically-geared users will truly appreciate.

Surge XT comes with a series of tutorials for the formula modulator available in the patch browser, 
each of them explaining different aspects and ideas you can re-create in the formula editor:

![](./images/Pictures/formula_modulator.png)

These tutorials are definitely worth consulting, but here are some basic principles that may help you get started
with the formula modulator.

Every formula modulator instance must containt at least a **process** function. This is where the modulator
output will be set or calculated.

Different **variables** can be accessed (and some modified), allowing you to create the desired modulation 
behavior:
- **rate** - Value of the modulator's Rate parameter.
- **startphase** - Value of the modulator's Phase slider.
- **amplitude** - Value of the modulator's Amplitude parameter.
- **deform** - Value of the modulator's Deform parameter.

- **output** - Output value of the formula modulator itself (ranges from -1 to 1).
- **phase** - Continuous value representing the realtime phase position of the modulator output.
- **intphase** - Integer value set to the number of cycles that have been executed.

- **released** - Is set to true when the modulator is in the release state.
- **songpos** - Host song position
- **tempo** - Host tempo
- **samplerate** - Host sample rate
- **block_size** - Buffer size used by Surge

You can access or modify those values by using the following syntax:<br/>

modstate["*variable-name*"]

To see a list of values corresponding to those variables, you can open the integrated Debugger by clicking on the
**Show** button at the right of the interface. This debugger also allows you to initialize the modulator by clicking
on **Init**, and to step through the code using the **Step** button.

Since Formula is an indexed modulator, you can have up to 8 different outputs on a single formula
modulator instance. This can be done by assigning the output to an array of values instead of a single
value. An example of this can be seen in the tutorial *Both Time And Space* (#10).

After entering code or modifying existing code, press the **Apply** button for changes to take effect.
You will see the output display update with the new shape.

Finally, you can switch to the **Prelude** view of the code by clicking on the corresponding button. The Surge
prelude is loaded in each surge session and provides a set of built in utilities we've found handy in writing
modulators.


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

#### LFO presets
To the left of the **Rate** parameter, a small menu icon can be found. Clicking on it will reveal options to
save the selected LFO state, open previously saved states, and finally rescan presets to update the list.
Presets will be categorized by modulation shape.

#### Copy/Paste options
Finally, after setting up an LFO, its settings with or without its targets can be copied and pasted to 
another LFO. To do this, simply right-click on the source LFO in the routing bar and use the desired 
**Copy** option, depending on what you want to replicate on the new modulation source. Then, use the
**Paste** option to paste it.

#### Renaming
LFOs and S-LFOs can be renamed to be more representative of their role and to help the user keep track of what each modulation source is doing in a patch. To do this, simply right-click on the LFO or SLFO in question, 
select **Rename Modulator...** and enter the desired name.

<br/>

For more information on LFO algorithms, see
[LFOs](#lfos) in the Technical Reference section.

<br/>
<br/>

### Internal modulators

#### Filter EG modulation source
The Filter Envelope Generator modulation source, which is labeled "Filter EG", is simply a modulation
source corresponding to the output of the Filter EG, which as its name suggests is already hardwired
to the filter modules. Other parameters can also be modulated by the Filter EG by various amounts,
simply by routing them to this source.

#### Amp EG modulation source
The Amp EG modulation source, which is labeled "Amp EG", is simply a modulation source corresponding to the
output of the Amp EG, which as its name suggests is already hardwired to the output amp module. Other
parameters can also be modulated by the Amp EG by various amounts,
simply by routing them to this source.

<br/>

#### Random modulation source
This modulation source operates at voice level. It will generate a single random value inside the modulation range
for each voice every time a voice is played.

By default, this modulation source is bipolar and its value distribution is uniform. However, you can
switch to a unipolar and normalled versions of it by right-clicking on it and selecting **Switch to...**,  and then choosing the desired type from the list. All of those can be used at the same time,
so they can be considered independent modulation sources.

Note that multiple parameters routed to that modulation source will all receive the same value (in percentage).
To send different randomized values to different parameters, multiple LFOs can be
configured in a way to do this and with greater control. See the explanation of
[the **Rate** parameter](#parameters).

<br/>

#### Alternate modulation source
This modulation operates at the voice level. It will generate alternating values between the two modulation range's
extremums.

By default, this modulation source is bipolar. However, you can switch to a unipolar version of it by
right-clicking on it and selecting **Switch to -> Alternate Unipolar**. The two can also be used at the same time,
so they can be considered two independent modulation sources.

<br/>
<br/>

### Voice and note properties

Like other synthesizers, Surge XT receives MIDI data to determine what note(s) to play.
However, it can also use **MIDI CC** data to modulate any routable parameter.

There are 14 of those voice and note properties in the routing bar:

|**Velocity**|Per note velocity amount|Voice modulator|Unipolar|
|**Release Velocity**|Per note release velocity amount|Voice modulator|Unipolar|
|**Polyphonic Aftertouch (labeled Poly AT)**|Per note polyphonic aftertouch|Voice modulator|Unipolar|
|**Channel Aftetouch (labeled Channel AT)**|Monophonic aftertouch if MPE is disabled|Scene modulator, <br/>Voice modulator in MPE mode|Unipolar|
|**Pitch Bend**|Pitch bend wheel value|Scene modulator|Bipolar|
|**Modwheel**|Modulation wheel value|Scene modulator|Unipolar|
|**Breath**|Breath controller signal|Scene modulator|Unipolar|
|**Expression**|Often used in pedals and for crescendos or decrescendos|Scene modulator|Unipolar|
|**Sustain**|Sustain signal, often from a pedal|Scene modulator|Unipolar|
|**Timbre**|Primarily used for MPE controllers|Voice modulator|Bipolar|
|**Keytrack**|Per note keytrack value|Voice modulator|Bipolar|
|**Lowest Key**|Keytrack value corresponding to the lowest note played|Scene modulator|Bipolar|
|**Highest Key**|Keytrack value corresponding to the highest note played|Scene modulator|Bipolar|
|**Latest Key**|Keytrack value corresponding to the latest note played|Scene modulator|Bipolar|

Note that only scene-level modulation sources can be routed to FX sends and parameters.
For instance, you can use **Latest Key** instead of **Keytrack** to modulate FX parameters, as Keytrack is
a voice-level modulation.
See [Voice modulators vs. Scene modulators](#voice-modulators-vs-scene-modulators) for more details.

<br/>
![](./images/Pictures/routingbar_sections.png)
<br/>

### Macros
There are 8 macros, and by default, they are blank.

What separates these assignable controllers from the rest is that with a right-click, they can be
assigned to a MIDI controller or any MIDI CC signal, and their value can be edited on-screen
with the blue digital slider below their names.

By default, the macros are assigned to midi CC 41-48, which is often mapped by default to knobs or
slider banks for a lot of midi controllers.

See [Continuous Controller information (CC)](#continuous-controller-information-cc) in the Technical Reference section for more information.


The right-click context menu also allows you to rename the controller.
There is also the typical routing and clearing options,
(see [Routing](#routing)) and you can choose if their modulation is bipolar (both positive and negative with 0
in the middle) or unipolar (just positive).

Macros can also be dragged and dropped over other macros to make them switch place. To do so, simply left-click + drag over the desired macro slot location.

Finally, note that macros are considered **global modulators**, meaning they are shared between and act on both
scenes A and B. This is useful in case you would want to quickly control certain parameters from both scenes
in a single place.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


# FX Section

The FX Section controls the 8 effect units of the effect block
stored in every patch.

<br/>

![FX Section](./images/Pictures/fxsection.png)

<br/>

## Effect Unit Selector
The effect unit selector can be found towards the top of the FX section. It also represents the signal path
of the effects block. Here it is in more detail:

![Illustration 18: The effect block](./images/Pictures/illu18.png)

*The effect block*

A **left-click** on a particular unit in the effect unit selector brings that unit in the editor.
A **right-click** on a unit disables/enables it. This state is stored within patches,
unlike the global FX bypass setting.

Moreover, you can drag-and-drop units over other units to make them switch places. Holding down **Ctrl/Cmd** and
dragging allows you to duplicate (copy) units on other units instead, and holding **Shift** allows to simply replace
(overwrite) the target unit with the source one.

Finally, you can right-click on either the **A** or **B** icons in the diagram to bring up output hard clipping
options, which are the same as explained earlier in the [Scene Output](#scene-output)
and [Global Volume](#fx-bypass-character-and-global-volume) sections.

<br/>

## Effect and preset picker
Effects can be added or removed from the **Effect and preset picker**
(just below the FX return sliders). You can also cycle through effects and presets using the
same arrow buttons as those found in the global [Patch Browser](#patch-browser).

You can also save your own effect presets which will be stored globally with
the synth. Finally, at the bottom of this menu, there are **Copy** and **Paste** options, which allows you to copy an effect and its parameters and paste it on another unit. You can also use drag-and-drop gestures to accomplish this
(see [Effect Unit Selector](#effect-unit-selector)).

<br/>

## Effect Editor
This is where every effect parameter can be edited. Like with the oscillator editor, the parameter of each slider
will change depending on the loaded effect.

Here's a list of the available effects:
- EQ
- Exciter
- Graphic EQ
- Resonator
- CHOW
- Distortion
- Waveshaper
- Neuron
- Tape
- Combulator
- Frequency Shifter
- Nimbus
- Ring Modulator
- Treemonster
- Vocoder
- Chorus
- Ensemble
- Flanger
- Phaser
- Rotary Speaker
- Delay
- Reverb 1
- Reverb 2
- Spring Reverb
- Airwindows (56 effects collection from Airwindows)
- Conditioner

See [Effect algorithms](#effect-algorithms) in the Technical Reference section for more information about each effect.

Note: remember that **FX parameters are scene controls**. This means that only scene-level modulation sources
can modulate them.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Microtuning
Surge is becoming well known for its extensive microtuning options, and Surge XT features full keyboard microtuning
support using the complete **Scala SCL** and **KBM** format, as well as integration with **ODDSound MTS-ESP**. 

When utilizing either of these microtuning modes, the musical intonation related features of Surge XT contextually
switch accordingly for the **Tune** and **Filter Cutoff** menus.


## Scala SCL-KBM mode

When using the default Scala SCL-KBM microtuning mode, users can right-click on the **Tune** button to view the
contextual **Tuning** menu options as follows:

![](./images/Pictures/tune_menu.png)

- **Current tuning** - Scala SCL (scale) tuning tables may be loaded into Surge XT using drag-and-drop onto its UI,
from the Factory Tuning Library, or the integrated Tuning Editor. Once an SCL file has been loaded, the filename of
the tuning will appear here, otherwise, with no SCL file loaded, this option will not be visible in the Tuning menu.
- **Current keyboard mapping** - Scala KBM (keyboard mapping) files may also be loaded into Surge XT using
drag-and-drop onto its UI, from the Factory Tuning Library, or the integrated Tuning Editor. Once a KBM has been
loaded, the filename of the keyboard mapping will appear here, otherwise, with no KBM file loaded, this option will
not be visible in the Tuning menu.

- **Open tuning editorâ€¦** Clicking this option will open the integrated Surge XT Tuning Editor with features for
loading, modifying, analysis and export of Scala SCL-KBM tuning tables that enable working with a broad range of
historical and contemporary musical intonation systems.

For more detailed information about microtuning and on the microtuning editor featured in Surge XT, see
[Tuning Editor](#tuning-editor).

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_radial.png)

*Radial page of the tuning editor*

<br/>

The following three Tuning menu options are available when Scala SCL and KBM files have been loaded into Surge XT, permitting resetting the instrument to standard intonation settings. When no SCL or KBM are loaded, these options are grayed out:

- **Set to standard tuningâ€¦** - Resets the currently loaded SCL tuning table to 12 tone equal temperament, keeping
the currently loaded KBM.

- **Set to standard mapping (concert C)** - Resets the currently loaded KBM, such that the 1/1 of the loaded SCL is
mapped to middle C.60 at 261.626 Hz

- **Set to standard scale (12-TET)** - Resets the currently loaded SCL tuning table to 12 tone equal temperament and
the KBM such that the 1/1 of the intonation is mapped to middle C.60 at 261.626 Hz.

<br/>

- **Load .scl scale...** - Allows the user to load SCL tuning table files from their computer.

- **Load .kbm keyboard mapping...** - Allows the user to load SCL tuning table files from their computer.

Note: Scala SCL and KBM files can also be imported via the Status Area, or via drag-and-drop anywhere on Surgeâ€™s
interface.

- **Factory Tuning Library**  - Clicking this option will open the file browser containing the included Surge XT
factory SCL-KBM content.

- **Remap A4 (MIDI note 69) directly toâ€¦** - Enables the user to type in custom Hz values for MIDI Note A.69.

- **Use MIDI channel for octave shift** - Enables users of generalized array keyboard controllers (such as the
Lumatone) to map large tuning gamuts and equal-temperaments contiguously across all 16 MIDI Channels.

- **Apply runing at MIDI input** - When this option is checked (which it is by default), modulation is tuned to
the loaded scale, and pitch bends are in key space.

- **Apply runing after modulation** - When checked, tuning is only applied at the keyboard, and modulation is in
12-TET space. Since this fundamentally changes how a patch would play in tuned mode, this option is stored at the
patch level. 

- **Use ODDSound MTS-ESP** - Activates **ODDSound MTS-ESP**. With this option checked and an instance of MTS-ESP
Master (or MTS-ESP Mini) is loaded into the DAW project, settings made in the MTS-ESP Master plugin then control the
intonation of Surge XT.

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_mts-esp.png)

*The Surge XT Tuning menu in MTS-ESP microtuning mode.*

## ODDSound MTS-ESP mode

As mentioned above, with the Tuning menu option checked for Use ODDSound MTS-ESP, and an instance of MTS-ESP Master (or MTS-ESP Mini) is inserted into the DAW project, the menu contextually changes, showing the following options:

- **Tuning (MTS-ESP)** - Indicates that an instance of MTS-ESP Master (or MTS-ESP Mini) is inserted into the DAW
project and is controlling the intonation of instrument.

- **Current tuning** - Displays the name of the currently active tuning in MTS-ESP.

- **Use ODDSound MTS-ESP** - When this option is checked, Surge XT is configured to operate with MTS-ESP.

- **Disconnect from MTS-ESP** - Provides a way to disable MTS-ESP in Surge XT, even when an instance of MTS-ESP
Master (or MTS-ESP Mini) are inserted into the DAW project, whereupon the Tuning menu will contextually switch to
the Scala SCL-KBM mode.

- **Query tuning at note on only** - Query tuning at note on only
Either snap the tuning at note on and hold it consistent through the note voice, or otherwise query the tuning as the note progresses. So if for example, you play a D and adjust the tuning of the second note in your scale with this on, you will hear the pitch change, while with it off you wonâ€™t.

Consult the documentation for ODDSound MTS-ESP Suite or MTS-ESP Mini for more detailed information about their operation.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


# Menu Button
You can find this menu in the bottom-right corner of Surge XT's interface.
Clicking it reveals various configuration options.

Note: Some of these options are also present at the top of the user interface for easier access
(see [Status Area](#status-area)).

This menu can also be opened by right-clicking anywhere on the user interface where there are no controls.

<br/>

### Zoom
The **Zoom** option can be extremely useful on certain monitors and configurations.

In its sub-menu there are various options to change the scale of the whole user-interface to a certain size.
Keep in mind that it will not let you change it to any size, as there is an upper limit depending on your screen resolution.

When a new instance of Surge is loaded, its zoom will be set to default size. To change this value,
go back in this sub-menu and select the option "Set [zoom %] as default", or "Set default zoom to ..." then enter the desired value.

<br/>

### Skins
This is where the UI skin can be chosen. Surge XT comes with two factory skins:
**Classic** and **Dark**.

**Classic**:

![](./images/Pictures/surge.png)

<br/>

**Dark**:

![](./images/Pictures/surge_dark.png)

<br/>

This menu also contains option to display the skin inspector or the skin development guide. Both will open in your
default browser.

<br/>

From there, you can also reload the current skin, rescan skins, open the current skin folder location, open the skin
inspector and open the skin development guide.

If you would like to get on board with the skin engine and developing skins,
see the documentation on [developing Surge XT skins](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/skin-manual.html).

<br/>

### Value displays
- **High Precision Value Readouts** - Allows value popups that appear when tweaking parameters to show more digits
after the decimal point (6 digits). This can be useful in some more advanced and precise scenarios.

- **Modulation value readout shows bounds** - Allows the value popup that appears when applying modulation and
adjusting its amount to a parameter to show more values, such as the relative range in the negative direction, 
and both absolute minimum and maximum values underneath.

- **Show value readout on mouse hover** - Allows you to enable or disable the gesture of hovering over a slider to
display its value.

- **Show ghosted LFO waveform reference** - Allows you to enable or disable the LFO waveform at full amplitude
displayed with a dotted line in the LFO display area.

- **Middle C** - Allows you to change the reference octave used in popup displays of some frequency-related parameters,
such as filter cutoff for instance. You can change Middle C to be either **C3**, **C4** or **C5**.

<br/>

### Data Folders
In this sub-menu, there are a couple of options regarding user data and patches.

**Open User Data Folder** - This opens the location where custom patches saved by the user will be stored.

**Open Factory Data Folder** - This opens the location where factory patches, wavetables and other
configuration files are stored.

**Set Custom User Data Folder** - This allows you to change where user patches will be saved.


**Rescan All Data Folders** - This option can be useful after importing patches created by someone else,
after transferring user patches to another computer, or after downloading patches from the internet.

<br/>

### Mouse Behavior
This sub-menu contains options allowing you to change the sensitivity of the mouse when moving sliders.
While *Legacy* is used by default, the other 3 options range from *Slow* (more granular) to *Exact*
(as fast as the mouse pointer). Also, there is an option to keep showing the mouse pointer on the
screen when dragging on a control.

Touchscreen mode automatically sets the mouse options to give the user the best experience when using Surge
on a touch screen.

<br/>

#### Patch Defaults
This is where you can configure what appears by default in the **Author** and **Comment** fields when saving a patch. You can also set the currently loaded patch as the default patch, append the original author
name to modified patches or not, and configure tuning and tuning mapping when loading patches.

<br/>

#### Workflow
- **Activate individual scene outputs** - Enable or disable the individual audio scene outputs. In most DAWs, this option
will be enabled by default, but for compatibility reasons, some other DAWs (such as FL Studio for instance) will have that
option disabled by default, and will need to be enabled then configured in the plugin wrapper to use this feature.

- **Load MSEG snap state from patch** - Tells Surge XT if it should load the MSEG snap parameters from the saved patch or
keep the existing settings.

- **Remember tab positions per scene** - Remember tab positions (for example, currently selected oscillator or
  LFO currently shown in the LFO editor) separately for each scene or unified in the whole synth.

- **Previous/next patch constrained to current category** - Turn this option off to allow the previous/next
patch arrow buttons in the patch browser area to automatically switch categories after hitting the end 
of one, for instance.

- **Tab key arms modulators** - Older versions of Surge had the **Tab** keyboard shortcut to arm modulation
mode. This behavior can be restored by enabling this option.

- **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Enables of disables the keyboard shortcuts. See 
[Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) for the full list of keyboard shorcuts available in Surge XT.

- **Show virtual keyboard** - Toggle this option to show or hide the virtual on-screen keyboard at the
bottom of the user interface.

<br/>

### MPE Options
**MPE** stands for **MIDI Polyphonic Expression**. It can be enabled or disabled in its sub-menu.
The current and default pitch bend range can be changed here as well. Finally, you can also configure
the MPE pitch bend smoothing amount.

<br/>

### Tuning Options

These options are also present in the Tuning menu at the top of the interface. See [Microtuning](#microtuning) for
detailed explanations on the tuning implementation within Surge XT.

<br/>

### MIDI Settings

This sub-menu contains options for MIDI mappings.

#### Controller smoothing
This sub-menu contains options to set the amount of desired MIDI controller smoothing.

#### Sustain pedal in mono mode

- **Sustain pedal holds all notes (no note off retrigger)** - If sustain is engaged and multiple notes are hit then
held one after the other, Surge XT will stay on the latest note when releasing it instead of switching to the previous
note.
- **Sustain pedal allows note off retrigger** - If sustain is engaged and multiple notes are hit then held one after
the other, Surge XT will switch to the previous note when the latest note is released.

#### Save MIDI Mapping As...

This allows you to save the current MIDI mapping. The newly created profile will appear in this menu under the two top options.

#### Show Current MIDI Mapping...
This opens up an HTML file listing the currently loaded MIDI mapping.

#### Clear current MIDI mapping
As its name suggests, this option clears the existing MIDI mapping in Surge XT and resets it back to default.

<br/>

### Online Options

The following items are for [reaching the developers and user feedback information](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/feedback), [reading the code on GitHub](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/), [downloading additional content](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Additional-Content), [opening Surge's website](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/), and finally
opening this user manual.

<br/>

### About Surge XT
Finally, there is an option to open the **About** pane containing various version, configuration and license information.

### Developer Menu
When right-clicking on the Menu button, some more options for development and testing purposes appear in various sub-menus.

<br/>
<br/>

# Technical Reference

## Surge XT Hierarchy

<br/>

### Overview

*Block diagram of the synthesizer engine.*

![Illustration](./images/Pictures/signal_flow.png)

Illustration shows an overview of the synthesizer engine of Surge XT.

<br/>

### Voices

![Illustration 17: Block diagram of a synthesizer voice](./images/Pictures/illu17.png)

*Block diagram of a synthesizer voice*

Illustration shows most audio and control-paths of a single
voice. Not all processing elements of the voice are shown in the
diagram.

<br/>

### LFOs

Each voice has 6 configurable LFOs and each scene has an
additional 6 configurable LFOs, making each voice effectively capable of receiving modulation from
a total of 12 LFOs.

![](./images/Pictures/tech_lfos.png)

*LFO block diagram*

<br/>

### Modulation routing in-depth

How the modulation routing works internally isn't something you normally
have to think about when using Surge XT. Just activate the modulation mode
with the desired source and see which of the sliders that become blue.
Nonetheless, it is useful to know which limitations are present and why.

![Illustration 19: Modulation routing behind the scenes](./images/Pictures/illu19.png)

*Modulation routing behind the scenes*

The thing to remember is that voice modulation sources can't
modulate scene parameters, global/effect parameters or parameters from scene LFOs, since these are two
distinctly different modulation paths. Other than that it should be pretty straightforward.

<br/>
<br/>

## Oscillator algorithms

Surge XT provides 8 different oscillator algorithms, each capable of
generating sound in different ways with a different set of controls.
They're not just different waveforms.

<br/>

### Classic

The classic oscillator algorithm consists of a main oscillator that can
generate a pulse wave, a sawtooth wave, a dual-saw wave or anything in
between.

A sub-oscillator provides a pulse-wave one octave below the main
oscillator. Changing the pulse-width of the sub-oscillator does affect
the main oscillator as well, as they will both change levels at the same
time except that the main oscillator does it twice as often.

The classic algorithm is also capable of oscillator self-sync. Note that
the sub-oscillator will be used as the base-pitch for the sync.

The algorithm provides unison at the oscillator-level with up to 16
instances. Unlike the wavetable-oscillator the cost of unison in terms
of CPU usage for the classic oscillator is quite modest. The unison
oscillator-instances are affected by the scene-level Osc-Drift parameter
independently.

### Modern

The Modern oscillator algorithm is a multi-waveform oscillator which creates clean,
low aliasing versions of pulse, triangle, saw and sine waveforms with unison and
sub-oscillator capabilities. It is based on the differentiated polynomial waveform
algorithm, from [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juhan-Nam/publication/224557976_Alias-Suppressed_Oscillators_Based_on_Differentiated_Polynomial_Waveforms/links/573f274d08ae9ace84133dc9/Alias-Suppressed-Oscillators-Based-on-Differentiated-Polynomial-Waveforms.pdf).

Three parameters labeled **Sawtooth**, **Pulse** and **Triangle** control relative mixes of those waveforms, while
the **Width** parameter controls pulsewidth for the Pulse wave. **Sync** offsets the pitch of the oscillator against the pitch of the internal reference oscillator
while resetting the phase of the main oscillator to the phase of the refrence oscillator, to achieve typical hard sync effects.
Unison controls work like in other Surge XT oscillators.

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sawtooth             | Amplitude of the Sawtooth waveform.                                                                             | -100 .. 100 %                                                  |
| Pulse                | Amplitude of the Pulse waveform.                                                                                | -100 .. 100 %                                                  |
| Triangle/Sine/Square | Amplitude of the third waveform, can be right-clicked (for more information, see below this parameter list).    | -100 .. 100 %                                                  |
| Width                | Duty cycle of the Pulse waveform.                                                                               | 0 .. 100 %                                                     |
| Sync                 | Oscillator hard sync.                                                                                           | 0 .. 60 semitones                                              |
| Unison Detune        | Detuning of unison oscillators.<br>Can be extended.<br>Can be switched between relative (default) and absolute. | 0 .. 100 cents<br>0 .. 1200 cents<br>0 .. 16 Hz<br>0 .. 192 Hz |
| Unison Voices        | Number of oscillators used for unison (1 = unison disabled).                                                    | 1 .. 16                                                        |

#### Third Waveform Parameter

The third waveform parameter (labeled "Triangle" by default) is special in that
it has several waveform options to choose from. If you right-click it, you can see
that it can generate a triangle wave, a sine wave, or a square wave. This control
can also become a sub-oscillator, playing at half the frequency of the other two waveforms.
Importantly, in sub-oscillator mode, the third waveform does **not** participate in unison,
which is in contrast to the Sub Mix parameter in Classic oscillator. Finally,
there is also an option for the sub-oscillator to bypass hard syncing against the internal reference oscillator.


<br/>

### Wavetable

A wavetable in Surge XT consists of up to 4096 single-cycle waveforms.
Using the **Morph** parameter it is possible to sweep across the waveforms
in the wavetable.

![](./images/Pictures/tech_wavetable.png)

The individual waves are equidistant in the table. When the shape
setting is between two individual waves, they will be mixed to ensure
smooth travel. You can't edit the wavetable contents directly within
Surge XT, but it is possible to generate custom wavetables with external
software.

Surge XT can also import wavetables containing a **clm** block to indicate loop size (as used by Serum),
a **cue** block (as used by various products including Native Instruments) and a **smpl** block.
Wavetable files without loop information are loaded as one-shots.

This effectively lets you import various wavetables from other products such as **Serum**.
All those 3rd party wavetables that have been tested in Surge XT have been reported to work flawlessly.

To import custom wavetables, use the wavetable selection bar at the bottom of the oscillator display. This is where you can also
[download additional wavetable content](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Additional-Content).

Alternatively, you can simply drag-and-drop any compatible wavetable file anywhere over the Surge interface to load it.

You can even create your own wavetables for Surge using [wt-tool](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Creating-Wavetables-For-Surge) or [WaveEdit](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synthesizer.github.io/wiki/Creating-Wavetables-With-WaveEdit).

Once a wavetable is loaded, you can also export it using the wavetable selection bar.

Then, by modulating the **Morph** parameter, it is possible to create motion,
dynamic response to playing and sonic variation. If you want to select an exact frame, drag the slider while holding
down Ctrl/Cmd, which allows you to snap to exact values in the table, useful for switching between distinct
shapes, for example.

What real-life property, if any, the **Morph** parameter is supposed to mirror depend on
each wavetable. Common cases are:

  - Analyzed from sounds that evolve over time. The behavior can be
    recreated by letting shape increase over time by modulation. It's
    the most common among the analyzed wavetables.
  - Analyzed from static sounds over different pitches to capture the
    formant shift of a sound. The behavior can be recreated by
    modulating shape by the keytrack modsource.
  - A parameter of a mathematical equation.

In the end it's just a set of data and Surge XT doesn't care how it was
generated, all that matters is how it sounds.

The wave-table oscillator has some interesting sonic characteristics. It
outputs the waveform in a stair-stepped fashion, making no attempts to
'smooth the steps' in the process, but does so in a manner that is
completely band-limited. This makes it similar in sound to 1980s era
wave-table synths and samplers which didn't use resampling but had
dedicated D/A-converters for each voice instead and changed the pitch by
varying the sample rate of the individual D/As.

The fact that the steps aren't smoothed causes an artifact known as
harmonic aliasing. This is not to be confused with inharmonic aliasing
which sounds somewhat similar to an AM-radio being tuned and is
generally nasty. Instead, this artifact will cause the harmonics of the
waveform to repeat themselves and fill up the entire audible spectra
even at low pitches, just like a square-wave would, preventing the
waveform from sounding dull. As this artifact is completely harmonic it
is also musically pleasing. Nonetheless, it may sound a bit out of place
on very smooth waveforms but the effect can be filtered out by a
lowpass-filter in the filter block if desired. Some of the wave-tables,
such as the regular triangle wave, are large enough for this artifact to
never appear in the normally used range for this specific reason.

The important thing is that just like most other oscillators in Surge XT,
it doesn't output any inharmonic aliasing whatsoever or any audible
levels of interpolation-noise, two artifacts which has played a big part
in giving digital synthesizers a bad name.

### Window

The window oscillator is another shot at wavetable
synthesis that is quite different from the previous wavetable algorithm.

The wave, which can be any waveform included with Surge XT, is multiplied
by a second waveform, the window, which can be one of 9 waveform types
that are specifically made for the window oscillator. The formant
parameter controls the pitch of the wave independently of the window,
but as the wave is always restarted with the window the pitch will
remain the same. Instead, the timbre of the sound will change
dramatically, much depending on which window is selected.

Unlike the wavetable algorithm, the window oscillator uses a more
traditional resampling approach which doesn't result in harmonic
aliasing.

### FM2

![FM2 modulation matrix](./images/Pictures/FM2.png)

FM2 provides a miniature FM-synthesizer voice in an oscillator that is
specifically tailored towards making nice and musical FM sounds. A
single sine carrier is modulated by two sine modulators, whose ratios to
the carrier are always integer thus the resulting waveform is always
cyclic. However, **M1/2 Offset** lets you offset the modulators slightly in
an absolute fashion, creating an evolving and pleasing detune
effect.

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| M1 Amount   | Modulation amount of the first modulator                                                      | 0 .. 100 %                        |
| M1 Ratio    | Ratio of the first modulator to the carrier                                                   | 1 .. 32                           |
| M2 Amount   | Modulation amount of the second modulator                                                     | 0 .. 100 %                        |
| M2 Ratio    | Ratio of the second modulator to the carrier                                                  | 1 .. 32                           |
| M1/2 Offset | Absolute detuning of the modulators<br/>Can be extended.                                      | -10 .. 10 Hz<br/>-1000 .. 1000 Hz |
| M1/2 Phase  | Changes the initial phase of the modulators to give different variations of the waveform.     | 0 .. 100 %                        |
| Feedback    | Modulation amount of the carrier to itself<br>Extended mode (default) can be disabled.        |-400 .. 400 % <br/> -100 .. 100 %  |

### FM3

![FM3 modulation matrix](./images/Pictures/FM3.png)

As a contrast to FM2, FM3 is the algorithm of choice for scraping paint
off walls. The modulators have a larger range, the ratios can be
non-integer and there's a third modulator which has its rate set as an
absolute frequency.

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| M1 Ratio     | Ratio of the first modulator to the carrier, can either be extended or absolute.       | 0.0 .. 32.00<br/>1/32.0 .. 32.0<br/>~ 8 Hz .. 24 kHz |

### String

The String oscillator uses a physical modeling technique where excitation sources
are sent into a tuned delay line with feedback, with various filters inline
(based on the original Karplus-Strong algorithm). The oscillator runs two strings
at all times which can be detuned from each other and individually damped.

To make the model create sound, you need to excite it. We have two classes of
excitation modes, **Burst** and **Constant**. In Burst mode, the delay line is loaded with a pattern
before a note is played, and then no further signal is added to the oscillator.
Think of this as emulating a plucked string. In Constant mode, the delay
line is also pre-loaded, but the signal continues to be applied for as long as you hold the key.
Think of this as emulating a bowed string. In almost all cases, Continuous excitation modes would be used
along with modulation of **Exciter Level** parameter, in order to emulate bow pressure, and so on.

Exciter modes provide various waveforms - noise, pink noise, ramp, etc. - which you can use to excite the strings,
leading to different timbres. Surge XT's audio input can also be used as an exciter signal!

|--- |--- |--- |
|Exciter|Determines mode and waveform used to excite the string.|Burst, Constant|
|Exciter Level|Determines how strongly the string gets excited.|-100 .. 100 %|
|String 1 Decay|Sets the decay time of the first string (amount of delay line feedback).|-100 .. 100 % |
|String 2 Decay|Sets the decay time of the second string (amount of delay line feedback).|-100 .. 100 %|
|String 2 Detune|Adjusts tuning of the second string.<br>Can be extended.<br>Can be switched between relative (default) and absolute.|-100 .. 100 cents<br>-1200 .. 1200 cents<br>-16 .. 16 Hz<br>-192 .. 192 Hz|
|String Balance|Adjusts mix between the two strings.|-100 .. 100%|
|Stiffness|Applies lowpass (left) and highpass (right) filters in the feedback loop, which emulates various levels of stiffness of the string. Results in inharmonic timbres at the extremes.|-100 .. 100%|

### Twist

This oscillator imports a rather famous Eurorack macro oscillator into Surge XT, based on Ã‰milie Gillet's
device. You can read the manual for the hardware module on which this oscillator is based
[here](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/manual).

This implementation presents all 16 oscillator modes and the controls are dynamically renamed
appropriately for every model. Core differences between the hardware module and Surge XT's implementation are:

1. By default, the LPG in the module is disabled, but by activating the LPG level and decay sliders with (right-click, then Activate),
the LPG will be triggered per voice for each received MIDI note.

2. By default, you can mix between the main and the auxiliary oscillator outputs with the **Mix** parameter.
You can also right-click the Mix parameter and enable **Pan main and auxiliary signals** option,
in which case -100% value is Main to left/Aux to right, +100% is Main to right/Aux to left, and 0% is an even mix of both signals sent to both left and right.
Do note that for this to be audible, you have to be in one of stereo filter configuration modes.

Twist can be more CPU demanding than most other Surge XT oscillator algorithms.
Judiciously using maximum polyphony setting and being careful with Amp EG release times 
can go a long way in minimizing the CPU usage, thus making robust patches.

### Alias

The Alias oscillator purposefully ignores a few decades of research into making digital signals with low or no
aliasing, and does all the things you shouldn't do, so it purposefully sounds digital, gross, broken, terrible,
yet awesome all at once.

#### Shape

**Shape** parameter (comes in the form of a menu) is very important and is worth explaining in more detail,
as it allows you to choose the source used for the Alias algorithm.

In addition to the more regular shapes (such as Sine, Ramp, Pulse and Noise), Surge XT's audio input can be also used.

Going further, there is Additive, which allows you to create a custom waveform by adjusting amplitudes of up to 16
harmonics, accessible by clicking on the Edit button that appears in this mode:

![](./images/Pictures/alias_additive_editor.png)

This editor works in a similar way to the step sequencer editor, however there are some additional options available when right-clicking:

- **Shapes** - Partial level presets which roughly represent different wave shapes, including a random option.
- **Absolute** - Sets the level of all the partials in the positive range.
- **Invert** - Flips the partial levels vertically.
- **Reverse** - Flips the partial levels horizontally.


Additionally, you can also use **Quadrant Shaping** waveforms as a source, which are also found in the
[Sine](#sine) oscillator.

Finally, we have various **Memory from...** options:

- **This Alias Instance** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with the currently selected instance of Alias.
- **Oscillator Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with general oscillator data.
- **Step Sequencer Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with step sequencer data.
- **Scene Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory associated with general scene data.
- **DAW Chunk Data** - Generates a waveform based on reading memory that serves as additional DAW chunk data (various non-automatable parameters and settings).

**Note:** When using **Memory From...** as a source, there is no guarantee that the resulting waveform
will be consistent, as memory data can vary depending on a number of things: the DAW used, the particular Surge XT instance, rebooting your machine, and so on.
Thus, it's good practice to bounce the audio output from Surge XT when using this mode.
You know what they say; "If you like it, you should... put a mic on it."

### S&H Noise

S&H is an abbreviation for 'Sample and Hold'. The S&H Noise oscillator algorithm works like a pulse oscillator,
but instead of always switching between +1 and -1, the levels used are determined stochastically.

The correlation parameter determines how new levels are calculated. A
setting of 0% will have no memory and each new level will
effectively be a random number (white noise). A lower setting will
favor new values that are closer to the previous level and will
provide noise with a darker spectra. Higher values will favor
values as far away from the previous one as possible, with 100%
resulting in a harmonic pulse wave.

| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Correlation   | Noise correlation. 0% = white noise, 100% = pulse wave.                                                         | -100 .. 100 %                                                  |

### Audio Input

Audio Input lets you route external audio into the voice architecture of
Surge XT. It also allows you to route the audio output from Scene A into Scene B.

Note: When using the Audio Input oscillator type in Scene B to get audio from Scene A,
you will likely want to **set Play Mode to Latch**. That way, Scene B will always be triggered.

## Filter algorithms

There are multiple filter algorithms available for each of the 2
filter units in the filter block. Each of the algorithms have
different subtypes, which alter their sound.

Some of the filter-(sub)types have some non-linear elements in them
to allow them to self-oscillate in a stable and predictable manner.
This means they will sound different depending on how hard they're
driven, which can be conveniently controlled with the Pre-Filter
Gain setting found in the mixer. For example, if the resonance peaks of a filter is too
loud, increase the Pre-Filter Gain to make the rest of the signal
more dominant (and if needed decrease the gain at the output stage
of the voice to compensate).

Filters in Surge XT are divided into the following categories:
- Lowpass filters
- Highpass filters
- Bandpass filters
- Notch filters
- Effect filters

### Filter Models
<br/>
**12 dB** - 2-Pole filter. Available in **Lowpass**, **Highpass**, **Bandpass**
and **Notch** types.

**24 dB** - 4-Pole filter. Available in **Lowpass**, **Highpass**, **Bandpass**
and **Notch** types.

Sub-types for both **12 dB** and **24 dB**:

1. **Clean** - clean with a strong resonance, capable of self-oscillation. Handles transient behavior extremely well.
2. **Driven** - chesty, somewhat distorted sound with a more held-back resonance. Capable of self-oscillation.
3. **Smooth** - the smoothest subtype, capable of lower resonance than the others, which is suitable when you do not want the sound of the filter to be noticed but only to roll-off a part of the spectrum.

<br/>

**Legacy Ladder** - 4-Pole ladder filter. This is Surge's original and older ladder filter.
It has stable self-oscillation and requires less CPU processing than the newer Vintage Ladder filter.

<br/>

**Vintage Ladder** - 4-Pole ladder filter. This is a more recent, accurate and often better-sounding ladder filter.
It also has stable self-oscillation, but requires more CPU processing than the older Legacy Ladder filter.
Available in **Lowpass** type.

Sub-types:

1. **Type 1** - Imitates a Moog resonant filter by Runge-Kutta numerical integration of
a differential equation approximately describing the dynamics of the circuit.

For more information on the development of the Tri-Pole filter, please see 
[this Python notebook](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-python/blob/main/scripts/dsp_simulations/ThreelerAnalysis.ipynb) 
which outlines the development of the signal processing building blocks behind the filter.

<br/>
<br/>

**Allpass** - As its name suggests, this filter passes all frequencies equally in gain. However, it is useful to alter the phase relationship in the spectrum. Unless feedback is involved, its effect can mostly be heard when the Cutoff frequency is in movement. Thus, modulation can be used to get interesting results.

Allpass can be found under the **Effect** category.

<br/>

**Comb +** and **Comb -** - Comb filter, which is different compared to the previous filter types since it doesn't
filter any part of the spectrum, but instead plays back the original signal with a delay. The former type has
positive feedback and the latter has negative feedback.

Sub-types:

1. **50% Wet**
2. **100% Wet**

When the sub-type is set to 2 and resonance is 0%, the
comb filter will work purely as a delay unit (with sub-sample
precision). This can be used together with the other filter unit
along with filter block feedback to provide interesting options. The
"Winds/Clarinet" and " Plucks/Simple Waveguide" presets
showcase how this ability can be used for simple physical modeling.
They only use the oscillator section to ignite the sound, the rest
is in the filter block.

Moreover, the negative comb filter produces the sound an octave lower than the positive comb filter.

Comb + and Comb - can be found in the **Effect** category.

<br/>

**Sample & Hold** - The Sample & Hold module will sample the audio at the rate set by the
cutoff frequency. Resonance will emphasize oscillations around the
cutoff frequency, not unlike the resonance peak of a lowpass filter.

Sample & Hold can be found in the **Effect** category.

## Effect algorithms

Surge XT has 8 effect units which each can run one of the 10 provided
algorithms.

<br/>

### EQ

The EQ unit provides 3-bands of fully parametric equalizing. This
high-quality algorithm has a much better response at high frequencies
than digital equalizers usually have.

|--- |--- |--- |
|Band 1/2/3<br>Gain|Band gain, can be disabled|-48 .. +48 dB|
|Band 1/2/3<br>Freq|Band frequency|14Hz .. 25kHz|
|Band 1/2/3<br>Bandwidth|Band bandwidth|0 .. 5 octaves|
|Output gain|Gain control|-48 .. +48 dB|
|Mix|Blend control between the dry and the wet signal.|0 .. 100 %|

<br/>

### Exciter

Exciter is a harmonic exciter based on the famous Aphex Aural Exciter unit.
For more information, see [this blog post](https://jatinchowdhury18.medium.com/complex-nonlinearities-epsiode-2-harmonic-exciter-cd883d888a43) by Jatin Chowdhury.

|--- |--- |--- |
|Drive|Controls the amount of generated harmonics.|0 .. 100 %|
|Tone|Controls the tone balance of the generated harmonics.|0 .. 100 %|
|Attack|Controls the attack time of the generated harmonics.|5 .. 20 ms|
|Release|Controls the release time of the generated harmonics.|50 .. 200 ms|
|Mix|Controls the mix of wet and dry signals.|0 .. 100 %|

<br/>

### Graphic EQ

Graphic EQ is, as its name suggests, a graphic equalizer. It is comprised of
11 level-adjustable and deactivatable (from the right-click menu) bands, which
makes this equalizer better than the normal EQ at sculpting relatively complex response curves.
Apart from the fact that there is also an output gain control at the bottom
of the interface, there is not much else to add.

<br/>

### Resonator

The Resonator provides carefully tuned lowpass, bandpass, bandpass + notch or highpass filters,
each with individual output gain and resonance. By default, the filters cannot be driven into self-oscillation,
but if you right-click any of the three **Resonance** parameters and enable **Modulation extends into self-oscillation**,
modulation sources can drive the filters to a self-oscillating point. Similarly, the three resonator bands
are tuned to match the ranges of a very famous resonator circuit, but they can be extended to allow a wider range.

|--- |--- |--- |
|Frequency 1/2/3|Frequency of the filter for the the first, second or third band.<br>Can be extended.|60 .. 300 Hz<br>60 .. 7500 Hz|
|Resonance 1/2/3|Amount of resonance for the first, second or third band.<br/>Modulation can be allowed to push the filter into self-oscillation from the right-click menu.|0 .. 100 %|
|Gain 1/2/3|First, second or third band gain.|-inf .. 0 dB|
|Mode|Sets the filter type used in the resonator effect.|Lowpass, Bandpass, Bandpass+Notch, Highpass|
|Mix|Controls the mix of wet and dry signals|0 .. 100 %|

<br/>

### CHOW

Chow is a half-wave rectifier distortion effect with controls similar to those found in a compressor.
The original effect was implemented as an [open source audio plugin](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/CHOW) by Jatin Chowdhury.

|--- |--- |--- |
|Threshold|Controls the threshold at which rectification starts.|-96dB .. 0dB|
|Ratio|Controls the amount of rectification.|1:1 .. 1:20|

### Tape

Tape effect is a port of the Chow Tape Model tape emulation effect, a real-time
physical model of a reel-to-reel analog tape machine. The model contains
parameters for controlling the amount of tape distortion and degradation,
as well as physical characterstics of the tape machine, like the play head
width, or tape thickness.

The original plugin can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel),
and signal processing details are outlined in [this 2019
DAFx paper](http://dafx2019.bcu.ac.uk/papers/DAFx2019_paper_3.pdf).

<br/>


### Combulator

Combulator effect is somewhat similar to the [Resonator](#resonator) in that it
is also made of three filter bands. However, it uses comb filters instead.
These three filters are tuned to a center pitch and two offsets, each with
its own gain control, and combs 2 and 3 with individual pan.
A common use case is to use a monophonic (scene-level) modulation source like **Highest Key** to modulate the
center pitch. The circuit also implements an envelope
follower on the input signal, and mixes additional noise in based on the followed envelope and the **Extra
Noise** parameter.

|--- |--- |--- |
|Extra Noise|Controls the level of extra noise added to the comb filters|0 .. 100 %|
|Center|Master center pitch control, offsets the three comb filters simultaneously|0.5 .. 25087.71 Hz %|

You can read the manual for the hardware device on which this effect is based
[here](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/manual).

The labels and ranges in the effect adjust based on the mode to allow you to use this
effect appropriately in Surge XT.

<br/>

### Treemonster

Treemonster is a specialized effect ported from Shortcircuit 2, a proper Vember Audio classic!
Treemonster runs a naive pitch detection algorithm on the input signal, runs a
sine oscillator at the detected pitch, then ring modulates the input signal with the
resulting tuned sine oscillator. It can get pretty crazy, especially if you apply pitch
shifts to the generated oscillator. Like the emulated analog ring modulation in Surge XT,
this effect can very rapidly become very inharmonic.

## Tuning Editor

The integrated Surge XT Tuning Editor has a built-in collection of microtuning utilities for loading, modifying,
analysis and export of Scala SCL-KBM tuning tables that enable working with a broad range of historical and
contemporary musical intonation systems. It is also worth mentioning here that Surge XT supports the use and
creation of non-monotonic intonation systems that may not necessarily be sorted in a linear order.

To open the Tuning Editor, right-click on the Tune button and from the Tuning menu, choose **Open tuning editorâ€¦**,
where the following features are available:

**Keyboard Mapping** - On the far left of the Tuning editor UI, there is a keyboard diagram showing the current
tuning and how  its frequencies are mapped directly to **MIDI Note Numbers** across the musical range.

Notice that when playing notes from a MIDI controller, that the keys will light up showing the notes that are being
played as well the fundamental pitches that Surge XT is sounding with each MIDI Note On.

<br/>

### Edit Modes
Along the bottom left of the Tuning Editor are five buttons that switch between the different editing and analysis 
functions:

<br/>

#### Scala 
Click Scala button, where the values for the currently loaded Scala SCL and KBM file can be viewed and
or edited. In the left pane is the Scala SCL, with the KBM on the right. Notice here too that input from an attached 
MIDI controller will highlight the scale degrees being played from the keyboard.

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_scala.png)

Itâ€™s possible to directly edit SCL and KBM values in either pane, then using the Save Scale feature, export the 
results to any directory on the userâ€™s computer. Editing SCL and KBM is a slightly advanced topic, so it is advised 
to only make changes to tunings here, when one understands how these features work for creating custom tuning tables 
that can be read by Surge XT, or any other virtual-instruments that use the Scala SCL-KBM format.

<br/>

#### Radial
Click the **Radial** button to access features for creating new scales, or otherwise modifying 
existing ones, with its features for tuning by ear using either the Scale Tones on the left, or the Tone Wheel on 
the right.

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_radial.png)

The **Scale Tones** features show the ratios or cents for each degree of the current tuning. The dials to the right of each scale degree can be used to retune each pitch of the scale by ear and the dial on the top right can be used to uniformly compress or stretch the current tuning. 

Holding **Shift** on the typing keyboard while moving the tuning dials counterclockwise or clockwise allows fine 
adjustments while retuning the scale by ear. Use the Hide button to hide the scale degrees when tuning by ear, then 
click Show to see the results of the tuning exercise.

It is also possible to type new values for each of the scale degrees in either ratios or cents.

Any changes made to the Scale Tones dials are immediately reflected on the Radial Tone Wheel to the right, and itâ€™s 
also possible to click on the circular nodes of the Tone Wheel and retune each by ear as well.

<br/>

#### Interval
Provides a way to view the intervals of the current scale, given any two notes in the loaded scale and show the 
interval in cents between them.

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_interval.png)

Itâ€™s also possible to hold keys on an attached MIDI controller, then click and drag on any of the columns to retune 
each degree by ear in real-time. 

Notice here too that input from a MIDI controller also highlights the scale degrees being played in the matrix.

<br/>

#### To Equal
Given any two notes in the loaded scale, show the distance to the equal division interval.

<br/>

#### Rotation
Shows the current tuning in an interval matrix for modal rotation analysis, where each row reveals the intervals 
available from each starting point of the scale.

### Actions

The Surge SXT Tuning Editor has a set of Actions with the following features:

#### Save Scale
Click this button to export the current scale in the Scala SCL format to any location on the userâ€™s computer, where 
they can later be loaded back into Surge XT, or other virtual-instruments that use the Scala format.

#### Export HTML
Opens the current scale in an HTML page, where users can view complete information about the intonation, including 
the Scala SCL scale degrees, the frequency mapping to MIDI Notes across the range, the KBM in use, as well as an 
interval matrix that shows the current tuning under both modal and interval rotation. More information can be found
below.

#### Tuning Library
Clicking the Tuning Library button will open the directory containing the Surge XT factory SCL and KBM content,
making it easy to drag-and-drop SCL and KBM files onto the UI.

<br/>
<br/>

### Export HTML

Clicking the Export HTML button from within the Surge XT Tuning Editor opens the current tuning in an HTML page 
enabling viewing information about the loaded Scala SCL and KBM files, and how the pitches are mapped to MIDI Notes
on the keyboard controller.

The exported HTML page then shows the tuning description contained in the SCL file, the degrees of the scale, and 
the mapping of pitches to MIDI Notes. Below we can see that the Bohlen-Pierce tuning is mapped with its 1/1 starting 
note on C.60 at 261.626 Hz. 

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_html-1.png)

To change the 1/1 mapping to another MIDI Note, drag-and-drop a different KBM file onto the Surge XT interface, then 
click the Export HTML button again to see how it changed the mapping.

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_html-2.png)

Below we can see that the 1/1 for Bohlen-Pierce is now mapped to MIDI Note A.69 at 440 Hz:

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_html-3.png)

Click the Raw Scala Tuning (SCL) or Raw Keyboard Mapping (KBM) links to view the mapping data for the currently loaded SCL and KBM files. 

![](./images/Pictures/tuning_html-4.png)

Click the Interval Matrices link to view a modal rotation of the current tuning by scale degrees and interval steps.

## Continuous Controller information (CC)

The eight macros towards the right of the routing bar have automatically assigned CC's.

The list is as follows:

**Control 1** = CC 41

**Control 2** = CC 42

**Control 3** = CC 43

**Control 4** = CC 44

**Control 5** = CC 45

**Control 6** = CC 46

**Control 7** = CC 47

**Control 8** = CC 48
